            <h2>1. Concepts of Statistical Population and Sample</h2>
            
            <h3>Population</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Population (or Universe):</strong> The entire group of individuals, items, or objects of interest in a statistical study.
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Finite Population:</strong> A population where the number of units is countable and finite.
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Example:</em> Number of students in your college.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Infinite Population:</strong> A population where the number of units is theoretically infinite or so large that it is considered infinite.
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Example:</em> The set of all possible outcomes of rolling a die repeatedly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Sample</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Sample:</strong> A subset or a part of the population selected to represent the characteristics of the whole population.
            </blockquote>
            <p>We study samples because it is often too costly, time-consuming, or impossible to study the entire population. The process of selecting a sample is called <strong>sampling</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> To find the average height of all students in your college (population), you select 100 students (sample) and measure their heights.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Primary and Secondary Data</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Primary Data</h3>
            <p>Data collected <strong>for the first time</strong> by the researcher, specifically for the purpose of the study. It is original, raw data.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Surveys, personal interviews, experiments, direct observation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Specific to the research needs, more reliable and accurate.</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Very expensive and time-consuming to collect.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Secondary Data</h3>
            <p>Data that has <strong>already been collected</strong> by someone else for some other purpose, but is used by the researcher for their current study.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sources:</strong> Government publications (e.g., census reports), company records, journals, websites, books.</li>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Cheaper and faster to obtain.</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> May not be perfectly suitable, data may be outdated or inaccurate. One must check its reliability and suitability.</li>

        <section id="data-types">
            <h2>3. Qualitative and Quantitative Data</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Qualitative (or Categorical) Data</h3>
            <p>Data that represents characteristics, attributes, or qualities. It cannot be measured numerically but can be sorted into categories.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Gender (Male, Female, Other)</li>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Eye Color (Blue, Brown, Green)</li>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Blood Type (A, B, AB, O)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Quantitative (or Numerical) Data</h3>
            <p>Data that is numerical and represents a measurable quantity. It answers questions of "how much" or "how many."</p>
            
            <h4>a) Discrete Data</h4>
            <p>Data that can only take specific, distinct values (usually integers). It is "counted." There are gaps between possible values.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Number of children in a family (0, 1, 2, 3... but not 2.5)</li>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Number of cars passing a toll booth in an hour.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>b) Continuous Data</h4>
            <p>Data that can take any value within a given range. It is "measured." There are no gaps between possible values (though our measurements are limited by our tools).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Height of a student (e.g., 170.5 cm, 170.51 cm...)</li>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Temperature of a room.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="scales">
            <h2>4. Scales of Measurement</h2>
            <p>These scales (or levels) describe the nature of information within the values assigned to variables. They are hierarchical (each level up adds more properties).</p>
            
            <h3>1. Nominal Scale</h3>
            <p>The simplest scale. Data consists of categories or names only. There is no natural order or ranking.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Identity (e.g., 'Male' is different from 'Female').</li>
                <li><strong>Operations:</strong> Counting (frequency), finding the mode.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Jersey numbers, zip codes, eye color, marital status.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Ordinal Scale</h3>
            <p>Data can be categorized and these categories have a natural order or rank. However, the *differences* between the ranks are not meaningful or uniform.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Identity + Order.</li>
                <li><strong>Operations:</strong> Count, mode, median, rank correlation.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Customer satisfaction (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent), educational level (High School, Bachelor's, Master's), grades (A, B, C).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Interval Scale</h3>
            <p>Data is numerical, ordered, and the differences between values are meaningful and uniform. However, there is <strong>no true zero point</strong> (zero is arbitrary and doesn't mean "absence").</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Identity + Order + Meaningful Differences.</li>
                <li><strong>Operations:</strong> Count, mode, median, mean, standard deviation. Addition and subtraction are meaningful.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit (0°C doesn't mean "no heat"), calendar years (Year 0 is arbitrary), IQ scores.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Ratio Scale</h3>
            <p>The highest level of measurement. It has all the properties of the interval scale, plus a <strong>true zero point</strong>, which indicates the "absence" of the quantity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Identity + Order + Meaningful Differences + True Zero.</li>
                <li><strong>Operations:</strong> All statistical operations, including multiplication and division (we can form ratios).</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Height, weight, age, income, distance. (0 kg means "no weight," $0 means "no money").</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> A classic question is "Differentiate between Interval and Ratio scales." The key answer is the <strong>true zero point</strong>. Ask yourself: "Does 0 mean the absence of the thing?" If yes, it's Ratio. If no, it's Interval.

                <li><strong>Class Limits:</strong> The lowest (Lower Limit) and highest (Upper Limit) values a class can have. (e.g., 10-19).</li>
                <li><strong>Exclusive Method:</strong> Class intervals like 10-20, 20-30, etc. The upper limit (20) is excluded from the first class and included in the next. This is the preferred method for continuous data.</li>
                <li><strong>Inclusive Method:</strong> Class intervals like 10-19, 20-29, etc. Both limits are included. To make it continuous for graphing, we must find <strong>Class Boundaries</strong> (e.g., 9.5 - 19.5, 19.5 - 29.5).</li>
                <li><strong>Class Mark (Midpoint):</strong> (Lower Limit + Upper Limit) / 2.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3. Cumulative Frequency Distribution</h3>
            <p>Shows the total frequency *up to* or *more than* a certain class boundary.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Less Than:</strong> Sum of frequencies from the top. (e.g., "Less than 20", "Less than 30").</li>
                <li><strong>More Than:</strong> Sum of frequencies from the bottom. (e.g., "More than 10", "More than 20").</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Graphical Representation (Histogram, Frequency Polygon, Ogive)</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Histogram</h3>
            <p>A graph of a continuous frequency distribution. It consists of adjacent rectangles.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>X-axis</strong> represents the class boundaries (using the exclusive method or boundaries from the inclusive method).</li>
                <li>The <strong>Y-axis</strong> represents the frequency.</li>
                <li><strong>There are no gaps between the bars.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Frequency Polygon</h3>
            <p>A line graph representing a frequency distribution.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is drawn by plotting the <strong>class marks (midpoints)</strong> on the X-axis against the <strong>frequencies</strong> on the Y-axis.</li>
                <li>The points are then joined by straight lines.</li>
                <li>The polygon is "closed" by joining the first and last points to hypothetical class marks at either end with zero frequency.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. Ogives (Cumulative Frequency Curves)</h3>
            <p>An ogive is a graph of a cumulative frequency distribution. It is used to find partition values like the median and quartiles graphically.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Less Than Ogive:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Plot <strong>Upper Class Boundaries</strong> on the X-axis.</li>
                        <li>Plot <strong>"Less Than" Cumulative Frequencies</strong> on the Y-axis.</li>
                        <li>The curve rises from left to right.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>More Than Ogive:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Plot <strong>Lower Class Boundaries</strong> on the X-axis.</li>
                        <li>Plot <strong>"More Than" Cumulative Frequencies</strong> on the Y-axis.</li>
                        <li>The curve falls from left to right.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="note">
                <strong>Finding the Median:</strong> The <strong>Median</strong> is the X-coordinate of the intersection point of the "Less Than" and "More Than" ogives.
