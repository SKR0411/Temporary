        <h2 id="topic1">Meaning, Scope, Importance and Limitations of Macroeconomics</h2>

        <h3>Meaning of Macroeconomics</h3>
        <p>The term "Macroeconomics" comes from the Greek word <em>"makros,"</em> meaning "large." Macroeconomics is the branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of the <strong>economy as a whole</strong>. Instead of focusing on individual units (like a single consumer or firm), it examines economy-wide aggregates (totals) such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Total National Income (GDP)</li>
            <li>The General Price Level (Inflation)</li>
            <li>Total Employment (Unemployment)</li>
            <li>Economic Growth</li>
            <li>Balance of Payments</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is also known as the <strong>Theory of Income and Employment</strong>.</p>
        
        <h3>Scope of Macroeconomics</h3>
        <p>The scope (areas of study) of macroeconomics includes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Theory of National Income:</strong> Studying the concepts of national income and its measurement (GDP, GNP, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Theory of Employment:</strong> Analyzing the causes of unemployment and the determinants of the level of employment (e.g., Classical vs. Keynesian theories).</li>
            <li><strong>Theory of Money:</strong> Understanding the functions of money, its demand and supply, and its impact on the economy (e.g., monetary policy).</li>
            <li><strong>Theory of General Price Level:</strong> Studying inflation, deflation, and their causes (demand-pull, cost-push).</li>
            <li><strong>Theory of Economic Growth:</strong> Examining the long-run factors that lead to an increase in a country's production capacity.</li>
            <li><strong>Theory of International Trade:</strong> Analyzing open-economy issues like exchange rates and the balance of payments.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Importance of Macroeconomics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Understanding the Economy:</strong> It provides a "big picture" view of how the economy functions.</li>
            <li><strong>Formulating Government Policy:</strong> It is the basis for government <strong>fiscal policy</strong> (taxes, spending) and <strong>monetary policy</strong> (money supply, interest rates) used to combat recessions, control inflation, and reduce unemployment.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Planning:</strong> Helps governments set targets for economic growth and development.</li>
            * <li><strong>International Comparison:</strong> Allows us to compare the performance of different economies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Limitations of Macroeconomics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fallacy of Composition:</strong> This is the biggest limitation. It's the mistaken belief that what is true for an individual part is also true for the whole.
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Example 1:</em> If one person saves more, they become richer (micro). If *everyone* saves more, demand falls, leading to a recession, and everyone becomes poorer (macro). This is the <strong>Paradox of Thrift</strong>.</li>
                    <li><em>Example 2:</em> If one farmer has a bumper crop, they benefit. If *all* farmers have a bumper crop, prices crash, and all farmers may suffer.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Excessive Generalization:</strong> It deals with aggregates, which can hide important structural changes or differences between sectors/regions.</li>
            <li><strong>Ignores Individual Welfare:</strong> A high GDP doesn't mean *everyone* is well-off (it ignores income distribution).</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic2">Introduction to National Income</h2>
        <p><strong>National Income</strong> is the total monetary value of all <strong>final goods and services</strong> produced by the residents of a country during a given period, usually one year.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is a <strong>flow concept</strong> (measured over a period of time), not a stock concept (measured at a point in time).</li>
            <li>It measures the economic performance and size of an economy.</li>
            <li>"Final goods" are goods for final consumption or investment, not <strong>intermediate goods</strong> (goods used up in the production of other goods). We only count final goods to avoid <strong>double counting</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic3">Measurement of Gross Domestic Product</h2>
        <p><strong>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</strong> is the market value of all final goods and services produced <strong>within the domestic territory</strong> of a country in a given period.</p>
        <p>There are three main methods to measure GDP, which should all give the same result:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Product Method (or Value Added Method)</h3>
        <p>This method sums up the <strong>value added</strong> by all producing firms in the economy. Value added is the market value of a firm's output minus the value of intermediate goods it purchased.</p>
        <span class="formula">
            Value Added = Value of Output - Intermediate Consumption
        </span>
        <span class="formula">
            GDP_MP = Sum of Gross Value Added by all firms in the economy
        </span>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> This method is the best way to avoid the problem of <strong>double counting</strong>. For example, in making bread, we add the value added by the farmer (wheat), the miller (flour), and the baker (bread), not the total price of wheat + flour + bread.
        </div>
        
        <h3>2. Income Method</h3>
        <p>This method sums up all the <strong>factor incomes</strong> earned by the factors of production (land, labor, capital, entrepreneurship) within the domestic territory.</p>
        <span class="formula">
            NDP_FC = Compensation of Employees + Operating Surplus + Mixed Income
        </span>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compensation of Employees (Labor):</strong> Wages, salaries, benefits.</li>
            <li><strong>Operating Surplus (Capital/Land):</strong> Rent, Interest, and Profit.</li>
            <li><strong>Mixed Income:</strong> Income of self-employed individuals (which mixes labor and capital income).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To get from this (NDP_FC) to GDP_MP, we must:
        <br><strong>GDP_MP</strong> = NDP_FC + Depreciation + Net Indirect Taxes (Indirect Taxes - Subsidies)</p>
        
        <h3>3. Expenditure Method</h3>
        <p>This method sums up all the final <strong>spending</strong> on goods and services in the economy.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <span class="formula">Y = C + I + G + (X - M)</span>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>C (Consumption):</strong> Spending by households on durable goods, non-durable goods, and services.</li>
            <li><strong>I (Investment):</strong> Spending by firms on new capital (machines, factories) and inventories. Also includes household spending on new houses.</li>
            <li><strong>G (Government Purchases):</strong> Spending by the government on goods and services (e.g., salaries, infrastructure). <strong>Note:</strong> This excludes <strong>transfer payments</strong> like pensions or unemployment benefits, as they are not payments for goods or services.</li>
            <li><strong>(X - M) (Net Exports):</strong> Exports (X) are spending by foreigners on our goods (an injection). Imports (M) are our spending on foreign goods (a leakage).</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic4">Circular flow of Income and Expenditure</h2>
        <p>This model shows how income and spending flow between different sectors of the economy.</p>
        
        <h3>Two-Sector Model (Households and Firms)</h3>
        <p>This is the simplest model, assuming no government or foreign trade.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Households</strong> own all factors of production (labor, land, etc.). They <strong>supply</strong> these factors to firms.</li>
            <li><strong>Firms</strong> use these factors to <strong>produce</strong> goods and services.</li>
            <li><strong>Flow 1 (Real Flow):</strong> Factors flow from households to firms. Goods & services flow from firms to households.</li>
            <li><strong>Flow 2 (Money Flow):</strong> Firms pay households <strong>factor incomes</strong> (wages, rent, profit). Households use this income to <strong>spend</strong> on goods & services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">[]</p>
        
        <h3>Four-Sector Model (Households, Firms, Government, Foreign Sector)</h3>
        <p>This is a more realistic model that includes <strong>leakages</strong> (withdrawals from the flow) and <strong>injections</strong> (additions to the flow).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Leakages (S + T + M):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Savings (S):</strong> Households save, removing money from spending.</li>
                    <li><strong>Taxes (T):</strong> Government collects taxes, removing money from spending.</li>
                    <li><strong>Imports (M):</strong> Money flows out to pay for foreign goods.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Injections (I + G + X):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Investment (I):</strong> Firms borrow savings to spend on capital.</li>
                    <li><strong>Government Spending (G):</strong> Government spends tax revenue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exports (X):</strong> Money flows in from foreigners buying our goods.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the economy to be in equilibrium, <strong>Total Leakages must equal Total Injections</strong>:</p>
        <span class="formula">S + T + M = I + G + X</span>
        <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">[]</p>

        <h2 id="topic5">Basic concepts and components of national income</h2>
        <p>This section explains the different "aggregates" of national income and how to get from one to another.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Conversion Rules:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Gross vs. Net:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gross</strong> = Includes depreciation (consumption of fixed capital).</li>
                    <li><strong>Net</strong> = Excludes depreciation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Net = Gross - Depreciation</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Domestic vs. National:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Domestic</strong> = Produced *within the geographical territory*.</li>
                    <li><strong>National</strong> = Produced *by normal residents (nationals)*, wherever they are.</li>
                    <li><strong>National = Domestic + Net Factor Income from Abroad (NFIA)</strong></li>
                    <li>(NFIA = Factor income from abroad - Factor income paid to abroad)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Market Price (MP) vs. Factor Cost (FC):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Market Price</strong> = What the consumer actually pays (includes taxes, excludes subsidies).</li>
                    <li><strong>Factor Cost</strong> = What the producer actually receives (excludes taxes, includes subsidies).</li>
                    <li><strong>Factor Cost = Market Price - Net Indirect Taxes (NIT)</strong></li>
                    <li>(NIT = Indirect Taxes - Subsidies)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>The Aggregates (A Step-by-Step Derivation):</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start with <strong>GDP_MP (Gross Domestic Product at Market Prices)</strong>.
                <br><em>(This is the main figure, e.g., from the Expenditure Method)</em></li>
            <li><strong>GNP_MP (Gross National Product at Market Prices)</strong>
                <br>GNP_MP = GDP_MP + NFIA</li>
            <li><strong>NNP_MP (Net National Product at Market Prices)</strong>
                <br>NNP_MP = GNP_MP - Depreciation</li>
            <li><strong>NNP_FC (Net National Product at Factor Cost)</strong>
                <br>This is the official <strong>"National Income" (NI)</strong>.
                <br>NNP_FC = NNP_MP - Net Indirect Taxes (NIT)</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Income (PI)</strong>
                <br>PI = NI - Corporate Taxes - Undistributed Profits + Transfer Payments</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Disposable Income (DI)</strong>
                <br>This is the income households actually have to spend or save.
                <br>DI = Personal Income - Personal Taxes
                <br>DI = Consumption (C) + Savings (S)</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Practice converting between any two aggregates. For example, to get from GDP_FC to NNP_MP:
            <br>NNP_MP = GDP_FC - Depreciation + NFIA + NIT.
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic6">Real and Nominal GDP</h2>
        
        <h3>Nominal GDP</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> GDP measured at <strong>current market prices</strong> (the prices prevailing in the year of measurement).</li>
            <li><strong>Formula:</strong> Nominal GDP = Current Year Quantity × Current Year Price</li>
            <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Nominal GDP can increase either because <em>production (quantity)</em> increased or just because <em>prices</em> increased (inflation). It's a misleading measure of growth.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Real GDP</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> GDP measured at <strong>constant prices</strong> (the prices from a fixed "base year").</li>
            <li><strong>Formula:</strong> Real GDP = Current Year Quantity × Base Year Price</li>
            <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> Real GDP only increases if the <em>quantity</em> of goods and services produced increases. It is the best measure of <strong>real economic growth</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>GDP Deflator</h3>
        <p>The GDP Deflator is a measure of the overall price level (inflation) in the economy. It is the ratio of nominal to real GDP.</p>
        <span class="formula">
            GDP Deflator = (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) × 100

        <p><em>Example:</em> If Nominal GDP is $150 and Real GDP is $120, the deflator is ($150 / $120) × 100 = 125. This means the price level has risen 25% since the base year.</p>

        <h2 id="topic7">GDP and economic well-being</h2>
        <p>Does a high GDP mean a high level of social welfare or well-being? Not necessarily. GDP is a flawed measure of welfare for many reasons:</p>
        
        <h3>Limitations of GDP as a measure of well-being:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Distribution of Income:</strong> A high GDP could be concentrated in the hands of a few (high inequality), so the average person may not be better off.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Market Activities:</strong> GDP excludes unpaid work, which has enormous value.
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Example:</em> Work done by homemakers, DIY projects, services of family members. If you pay a chef, it's GDP; if you cook at home, it's not.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Externalities (Negative):</strong> GDP can *increase* due to harmful activities.
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Example:</em> A factory pollutes (which isn't subtracted from GDP). Then, the government spends money to clean it up (which is *added* to GDP). GDP rises, but welfare has fallen.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>The "Black" or Informal Economy:</strong> Illegal activities and cash-in-hand transactions are not recorded, so GDP is underestimated.</li>
            <li><strong>Leisure:</strong> GDP doesn't value leisure time. If everyone works 80 hours a week, GDP might soar, but well-being would collapse.</li>
            <li><strong>Composition of Output:</strong> GDP only measures *how much* is produced, not *what* is produced. A country that produces more weapons and a country that produces more schools could have the same GDP, but different welfare levels.</li>
        </ol>
