        <h2 id="topic1">Meaning, Nature, Scope, Importance, and Limitations of Microeconomics</h2>

        <h3>Meaning of Microeconomics</h3>
        <p>The term "Microeconomics" is derived from the Greek word <em>"mikros,"</em> meaning "small." Microeconomics is the branch of economics that studies the behavior of <strong>individual economic units</strong>. These units include individual consumers, households, firms, or specific industries.</p>
        <p>It focuses on how these individual units make decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources and how their interactions determine the prices and quantities of goods and services. For this reason, microeconomics is also often called <strong>Price Theory</strong>.</p>
        
        <h3>Nature of Microeconomics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Individualistic Study:</strong> It doesn't study the economy as a whole (that's macroeconomics). It 'zooms in' on the individual parts.</li>
            <li><strong>Based on Assumptions:</strong> Microeconomics relies heavily on assumptions to simplify complex reality. The most common assumption is <em>"ceteris paribus,"</em> which means "all other things being equal."</li>
            <li><strong>Price Determination:</strong> Its central focus is determining the prices of goods (in the product market) and factors of production like land, labor, and capital (in the factor market).</li>
            <li><strong>Use of Models:</strong> It uses simplified economic models (like the demand and supply model) to analyze and predict behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Partial Equilibrium:</strong> It generally uses partial equilibrium analysis, which studies the equilibrium of one market or unit in isolation, assuming other markets are unchanged.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Scope of Microeconomics</h3>
        <p>The scope of microeconomics is wide and covers the following key areas:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Theory of Demand:</strong> Analyzes consumer behavior, how they choose goods, and how factors like price and income affect their choices (utility analysis, indifference curve).</li>
            <li><strong>Theory of Production and Cost:</strong> Studies how firms combine resources (inputs) to produce goods (outputs) efficiently and how their costs behave (production functions, cost curves).</li>
            <li><strong>Theory of Product Pricing (Price Determination):</strong> Explains how prices are set in different market structures, such as perfect competition, monopoly, and monopolistic competition.</li>
            <li><strong>Theory of Factor Pricing:</strong> Determines the prices paid for factors of production. This includes the determination of wages (for labor), rent (for land), interest (for capital), and profit (for entrepreneurship).</li>
            <li><strong>Welfare Economics:</strong> Deals with economic efficiency and social welfare. It assesses how well an economy allocates resources to maximize overall societal well-being.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Importance of Microeconomics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Understanding the Economy:</strong> It helps understand how our market-based economy functions.</li>
            <li><strong>Price Determination:</strong> Explains how the prices of millions of goods and services are determined.</li>
* <li><strong>Business Decision-Making:</strong> Firms use microeconomic principles to make decisions on pricing, production levels, costs, and investment.</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> It shows how scarce resources are efficiently allocated among competing uses.</li>
            <li><strong>Basis for Public Policy:</strong> Governments use it to formulate policies like taxes, subsidies, price controls (e.g., minimum wage), and trade policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Foundation for Macroeconomics:</strong> The behavior of the entire economy (macro) is the sum of the behaviors of its individual parts (micro).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Limitations of Microeconomics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unrealistic Assumptions:</strong> Many models assume perfect competition, full employment, and perfect information, which are rare in the real world.</li>
            <li><strong>Fallacy of Composition:</strong> It assumes that what is true for an individual part is also true for the whole. For example, saving more may be good for one person, but if everyone saves more, it can lead to a recession (this is the "paradox of thrift").</li>
            * <li><strong>Static Analysis:</strong> Many microeconomic models analyze a single point in time (static equilibrium) and don't fully capture the dynamic changes in an economy.</li>
            <li><strong>Ignores Macro Issues:</strong> It cannot explain economy-wide problems like inflation, unemployment, or economic growth.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic2">Basic Problem of Economics</h2>
        
        <p>The <strong>basic problem of economics</strong>, also known as the <strong>central economic problem</strong>, arises because of two fundamental facts of life:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Human wants are unlimited:</strong> People always desire more goods and services. Once one want is satisfied, another emerges.</li>
            <li><strong>Resources are scarce:</strong> The resources (or factors of production) needed to produce goods and services—land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship—are limited in supply.</li>
        </OL>
        
        <p>This conflict between <strong>unlimited wants</strong> and <strong>scarce resources</strong> forces every society, rich or poor, to make choices. This problem of choice leads to three basic economic questions:</p>
        
        <h3>The Three Basic Economic Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. What to produce?</strong>
                <p>Since resources are scarce, a society cannot produce everything. It must decide <em>which</em> goods and services to produce and in <em>what quantities</em>. For example, should it produce more consumer goods (like cars and smartphones) or more capital goods (like machinery and factories)? More guns or more butter?</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>2. How to produce?</strong>
                <p>This question concerns the choice of production techniques. Should goods be produced using <strong>labor-intensive methods</strong> (more workers) or <strong>capital-intensive methods</strong> (more machines)? The choice depends on the availability and cost of labor and capital.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>3. For whom to produce?</strong>
                <p>This is the problem of distribution. How will the total output of goods and services be divided among the members of society? Should it be based on income, wealth, or need? This question relates to the distribution of income (wages, rent, interest, profit).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic3">Problems of Scarcity and Choice, Economic Systems</h2>
        
        <h3>Problems of Scarcity and Choice</h3>
        <p>As established, <strong>scarcity</strong> is the fundamental economic problem. It means that society has limited resources and therefore cannot produce all the goods and services people wish to have. Because of scarcity, we must make <strong>choices</strong>.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Opportunity Cost:</strong> The most important concept related to choice is opportunity cost. It is the value of the <strong>next-best alternative forgone</strong> when a choice is made.<br><br>
            <em>Example:</em> If you have $20 and you choose to buy a book, you cannot use that same $20 to buy dinner. The opportunity cost of buying the book is the dinner you had to give up.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Production Possibility Frontier (PPF)</h3>
        <p>The concepts of scarcity, choice, and opportunity cost can be illustrated using a model called the <strong>Production Possibility Frontier (PPF)</strong> or Production Possibility Curve (PPC).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The PPF is a curve that shows the various combinations of two goods that an economy can produce efficiently with its given resources and technology.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Concepts Illustrated by the PPF:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scarcity:</strong> Represented by the boundary itself. Combinations outside the curve (like point Z) are unattainable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Choice:</strong> Society must choose one point on the curve (like A, B, or C).</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Any point <em>on</em> the curve (A, B, C) represents full and efficient use of resources (productive efficiency). Any point <em>inside</em> the curve (like point X) is inefficient (e.g., unemployment).</li>
                    <li><strong>Opportunity Cost:</strong> The <strong>concave (bowed-out) shape</strong> of the PPF shows <em>increasing opportunity cost</em>. As you produce more of one good (e.g., moving from A to B), you must give up increasingly larger amounts of the other good.</li>
                    <li><strong>Economic Growth:</strong> An outward shift of the entire PPF, caused by more resources or better technology.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">
            []
        </p>
        
        <h3>Economic Systems</h3>
        <p>An economic system is the method a society uses to answer the three basic economic questions (What, How, and For Whom to produce?).</p>

        <h2 id="topic4">Positive and Normative Economics</h2>
        
        <p>Economics can be divided into two types of analysis based on its purpose: positive and normative.</p>
        
        <h3>Positive Economics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> It describes and explains economic phenomena as they <em>are</em>. It deals with facts, data, and causal relationships.</li>
            <li><strong>Nature:</strong> It is <strong>objective</strong> and "what is."</li>
            <li><strong>Testability:</strong> Statements can be tested, verified, or refuted by checking them against real-world data.</li>
            <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> "is," "was," "will be," "causes."</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> "An increase in the price of petrol <em>will lead</em> to a decrease in the quantity demanded of cars." (This is a testable hypothesis).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Normative Economics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> It makes recommendations or value judgments about what the economy <em>ought to be</em> or what policy <em>should be</em> pursued.</li>
            <li><strong>Nature:</strong> It is <strong>subjective</strong> and "what should be."</li>
            <li><strong>Testability:</strong> Statements are based on opinions, values, and ethics. They cannot be scientifically tested or proven true or false.</li>
            <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> "should," "ought to," "fair," "unfair," "good," "bad."</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> "The government <em>should</em> provide free healthcare to all citizens." (This is a value judgment, not a testable fact).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> A common question is to identify whether a statement is positive or normative. Look for facts (positive) vs. opinions or recommendations (normative).
