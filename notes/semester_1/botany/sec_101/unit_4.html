        <h2 id="topic1">Active principles and methods of their testing</h2>
        
        <h3>Active Principles (Phytochemicals/Secondary Metabolites)</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Active Principles:</strong> These are the specific chemical compounds found in a medicinal plant that are responsible for its therapeutic (healing) effect.
        </blockquote>
        <p>They are also called <strong>secondary metabolites</strong> because they are not essential for the plant's basic survival (like primary metabolites - carbs, proteins), but are instead produced for defense, attraction, or signaling.</p>
        <p>Major classes of active principles include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alkaloids:</strong> Nitrogen-containing, basic compounds. Often have powerful physiological effects. (e.g., <strong>Morphine</strong> from Opium, <strong>Quinine</strong> from Cinchona, <strong>Reserpine</strong> from Sarpagandha).</li>
            <li><strong>Glycosides:</strong> A molecule where a sugar (glycone) is bound to a non-sugar (aglycone). The "aglycone" part is usually the active component. (e.g., <strong>Digitoxin</strong> from Foxglove).</li>
            <li><strong>Flavonoids:</strong> A large group of phenolic compounds. Often responsible for plant pigments (yellow, red, blue). Many are strong <strong>antioxidants</strong>. (e.g., <strong>Quercetin</strong> in onions).</li>
            <li><strong>Terpenoids:</strong> A large class of lipids built from isoprene units. (e.g., <strong>Menthol</strong> from mint, <strong>Taxol</strong> from yew, <strong>Cannabinoids</strong> from cannabis).</li>
            <li><strong>Phenolic Compounds:</strong> Contain a phenol ring. (e.g., <strong>Tannins</strong>, which are astringent; Salicylic acid from Willow bark).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Methods of their Testing (Extraction & Analysis)</h3>
        <p>Testing involves extracting these compounds from the plant and then identifying/quantifying them.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Extraction:</strong> The plant material (crude drug) is dried, powdered, and then mixed with a solvent (e.g., alcohol, water, ether) to dissolve the active principles. The liquid extract is then filtered and concentrated.</li>
            <li><strong>Analysis & Testing:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Phytochemical Screening:</strong> Simple, qualitative test-tube reactions to check *if* a class of compound is present (see topic 6).</li>
                    <li><strong>Chromatography:</strong> The primary tool for separation and identification.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>TLC (Thin Layer Chromatography):</strong> A simple, fast method to separate compounds on a coated plate. Used for identification.</li>
                            <li><strong>HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography):</strong> A sophisticated, high-pressure, quantitative method. It can separate, identify, and tell you *how much* of a compound is present. This is the industry standard for quality control.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Spectroscopy:</strong> Used to determine the chemical structure of an isolated compound (e.g., UV-Vis Spectroscopy, Mass Spectrometry).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="topic2">Management of herbal medicines</h2>
        <p>This refers to the proper handling of medicinal plants from collection to consumption to ensure safety, quality, and efficacy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Collection:</strong> Plants must be collected at the right time of year and day, and from the correct species. They must be free from pollution (e.g., pesticides, heavy metals).</li>
            <li><strong>Drying:</strong> Crude drugs must be dried properly (e.g., shade-drying, sun-drying) to reduce moisture, prevent microbial spoilage, and preserve the active principles.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Dried drugs must be stored in cool, dry, dark conditions in airtight containers to protect them from moisture, insects, rodents, and light (which can degrade compounds).</li>
            <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Proper cleaning, garbling (removal of foreign matter), and size reduction (powdering).</li>
            <li><strong>Standardization:</strong> Ensuring that every batch of the final herbal product (e.g., a capsule) has the same quality and the same concentration of active principles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic3">Drug adulteration (types)</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Adulteration:</strong> The practice of substituting the original crude drug with other, similar-looking substances that are of inferior quality, less effective, or harmful. This is usually done for financial gain.
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Types of Adulteration</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Substitution with Inferior Varieties:</strong> Using a related, but cheaper, species of the plant that has fewer active principles.</li>
            <li><strong>Substitution with Exhausted Drugs:</strong> Using a drug where the active principles have already been extracted (e.g., using "spent" ginger or cloves that have already had their essential oils removed).</li>
            <li><strong>Addition of Foreign Organic Matter:</strong> Mixing the drug with worthless plant parts (e.g., adding stems to a leaf drug, or adding mango-seed powder to amla powder).</li>
            <li><strong>Addition of Artificial Substitutes:</strong> Using man-made materials to mimic the drug (e.g., adding small, artificially-colored pebbles to look like cardamom seeds).</li>
            <li><strong>Addition of Harmful Substances:</strong> Adding toxic materials to enhance color or weight (e.g., adding brick powder to chili powder, or lead chromate to turmeric).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic4">Methods of drug evaluation</h2>
        <p>Drug evaluation is the process of quality control to confirm the <strong>identity, purity, and quality</strong> of a crude drug and to detect adulteration.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Organoleptic Evaluation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Uses the sensory organs (sight, smell, taste, touch).</li>
                    <li>Checks the drug's <strong>color, odor, taste, size, shape, and texture</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Example: Smelling cinnamon bark, tasting a licorice root for sweetness.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Microscopic Evaluation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Uses a microscope to examine the fine cellular structure of the drug.</li>
                    <li>Looks for specific, diagnostic features (e.g., types of stomata, trichomes (hairs), stone cells, calcium oxalate crystals).</li>
                    <li>Example: Identifying senna leaf powder by its unique unicellular trichomes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Physical Evaluation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Uses physical constants.</li>
                    <li>Examples: Measuring <strong>moisture content</strong> (should be low), <strong>ash value</strong> (total ash, acid-insoluble ash – high ash indicates soil/sand adulteration), and <strong>extractive value</strong> (how much dissolves in a specific solvent).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Chemical Evaluation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simple chemical tests (phytochemical screening) to identify the class of active principles (see topic 6).</li>
                    <li>Quantitative chemical assays to determine the *amount* of active principle (e.g., total alkaloid content).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Chromatographic & Spectroscopic Evaluation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The most advanced method. Uses techniques like <strong>TLC</strong> and <strong>HPLC</strong> to create a chemical "fingerprint" of the drug.</li>
                    <li>This fingerprint can be compared to a standard, authentic sample to confirm identity and purity.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="topic5">WHO guidelines for the assessment of herbal medicines</h2>
        <p>The <strong>World Health Organization (WHO)</strong> has established guidelines to help countries regulate and assess herbal medicines, ensuring they are <strong>safe, effective, and of good quality</strong>.</p>
        <p>Key points from the guidelines include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Quality Control:</strong> The herbal product must be fully characterized. This includes:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Botanical Identity:</strong> Proper species identification (macroscopic, microscopic, and chemical).</li>
                    <li><strong>Purity:</strong> Must be tested for and be within safe limits for contaminants like <strong>pesticides, heavy metals (lead, mercury), microbial contamination (bacteria, fungi), and mycotoxins (aflatoxins)</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assay:</strong> The *quantity* of the main active principles should be determined and standardized (e.g., "each capsule contains 5 mg of reserpine").</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Safety & Efficacy:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Traditional Use:</strong> If a product has been used traditionally for a long time without harm, this can be accepted as proof of safety.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clinical Trials:</strong> For new herbal products or new claims, scientific evidence (toxicology studies, clinical trials) is required, similar to modern drugs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Labeling:</strong> All products must be labeled accurately with the botanical name of the plant(s), the part used, the quantity, and clear indications for use and contraindications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic6">Phytochemical screening tests for secondary metabolites</h2>
        <p>These are simple, rapid, qualitative (test-tube) tests used in the lab to detect the *presence* of different classes of secondary metabolites in a plant extract.</p>
