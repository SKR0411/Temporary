        <h2 id="topic1">Brief history of use of medicinal herbs</h2>
        <p>The use of plants for healing is as old as humanity itself. Prehistoric humans would have used trial and error to learn which plants were edible, poisonous, or had healing properties, passing this knowledge down through generations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ancient Civilizations:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sumerians (c. 3000 BC):</strong> Cuneiform tablets list hundreds of medicinal plants (e.g., Myrrh, Opium).</li>
                    <li><strong>Egyptians (c. 1550 BC):</strong> The <strong>"Ebers Papyrus"</strong> is a famous medical scroll listing over 850 herbal remedies (e.g., Garlic, Senna, Aloe).</li>
                    <li><strong>India (c. 1500 BC):</strong> The <strong>Vedas</strong>, particularly the Atharvaveda, contain hymns and verses detailing the use of herbs. This laid the foundation for <strong>Ayurveda</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>China (c. 2700 BC):</strong> Emperor Shen Nung is credited with the <strong>"Pen Ts'ao"</strong> (Herbal), a text describing over 300 medicinal plants (e.g., Ephedra, Ginseng).</li>
                    <li><strong>Greeks (c. 400 BC):</strong> <strong>Hippocrates</strong>, the "Father of Medicine," advocated for a rational use of herbal remedies. <strong>Theophrastus</strong>, a student of Aristotle, wrote "Enquiry into Plants," a foundational text of botany.</li>
                    <li><strong>Romans (c. 60 AD):</strong> <strong>Dioscorides</strong> wrote <strong>"De Materia Medica,"</strong> a comprehensive encyclopedia of over 600 medicinal plants that became the standard medical text in Europe for 1,500 years.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Middle Ages:</strong> Herbal knowledge was preserved in monasteries in Europe. Arabic scholars like <strong>Avicenna</strong> (Ibn Sina) wrote "The Canon of Medicine," which integrated Greek and Indian knowledge.</li>
            <li><strong>Modern Era:</strong> The rise of synthetic chemistry led to the isolation of active compounds from plants (e.g., <strong>Morphine</strong> from opium poppy, <strong>Quinine</strong> from cinchona bark). Today, many modern drugs are either derived from plants or synthesized based on plant-derived compounds.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic2">Indigenous system of medicines: Ayurveda</h2>
        
        <h3 id="subtopic2-1">History and origin</h3>
        <p><strong>Ayurveda</strong> (from Sanskrit: <em>'Ayur'</em> = life, <em>'Veda'</em> = knowledge or science) translates to "The Science of Life." It is one of the world's oldest holistic (whole-body) healing systems, originating in India over 5,000 years ago.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Believed to be of divine origin, passed from the creator (Brahma) to sages.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Texts:</strong> The foundational knowledge is found in the Vedas. The "Great Trilogy" of classical Ayurvedic texts are:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Charaka Samhita</strong> (by Charaka) - Focuses on internal medicine.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sushruta Samhita</strong> (by Sushruta) - Focuses on surgery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ashtanga Hridaya</strong> (by Vagbhata) - A concise summary of the first two.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Core Philosophy:</strong> Ayurveda is based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between the mind, body, and spirit. It aims to promote good health, not just fight disease.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="subtopic2-2">Panchamahabhutas (The Five Great Elements)</h3>
        <p>Ayurveda posits that all matter in the universe, including the human body, is composed of five basic elements:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Akasha</strong> (Ether or Space)</li>
            <li><strong>Vayu</strong> (Air)</li>
            <li><strong>Teja / Agni</strong> (Fire)</li>
            <li><strong>Aapa / Jala</strong> (Water)</li>
            <li><strong>Prithvi</strong> (Earth)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These elements combine to form all substances, and in the body, they form the basis for the *Tridosha* and *Saptadhatu*.</p>

        <h3 id="subtopic2-3">Saptadhatu (The Seven Body Tissues)</h3>
        <p>These are the seven fundamental tissues that make up the human body. They are nourished in sequence by food.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Rasa</strong> (Plasma / Lymph) - Provides nourishment.</li>
            <li><strong>Rakta</strong> (Blood) - Governs oxygenation.</li>
            <li><strong>Mamsa</strong> (Muscle) - Provides movement and strength.</li>
            <li><strong>Meda</strong> (Fat / Adipose tissue) - Provides insulation and lubrication.</li>
            <li><strong>Asthi</strong> (Bone) - Provides support and structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Majja</strong> (Marrow / Nerve tissue) - Fills bone cavities and governs senses.</li>
            <li><strong>Shukra</strong> (Reproductive tissue) - Responsible for reproduction.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="subtopic2-4">Tridosha (The Three Humors)</h3>
        <p>This is the central concept of Ayurveda. The five elements (Panchamahabhutas) combine to form three fundamental energies or "doshas" that govern all physiological and psychological functions of the body.</p>
        <blockquote>
            An individual's unique ratio of these three doshas at birth is their <strong>Prakriti</strong> (constitution). Imbalance (<strong>Vikriti</strong>) in these doshas leads to disease.

        <h3 id="subtopic2-5">Rasayana (Rejuvenation Therapy)</h3>
        <p><strong>Rasayana</strong> is a specialized branch of Ayurveda that deals with rejuvenation and longevity. It is not a single drug, but a therapeutic process to enhance the quality of *dhatus* (tissues), boost *ojas* (vitality/immunity), and promote a long, healthy life.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Aims:</strong> To prevent aging, improve memory, increase strength, and enhance immunity.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Herbs like <strong>Ashwagandha</strong>, <strong>Amalaki</strong> (Indian Gooseberry), and <strong>Guduchi</strong> are prominent Rasayanas.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="subtopic2-6">Plants used in ayurvedic treatments</h3>
        <p>Ayurveda uses thousands of plants. Some common examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ashwagandha</strong> (<em>Withania somnifera</em>): A *Rasayana* used for stress, anxiety, and vitality.</li>
            <li><strong>Brahmi</strong> (<em>Bacopa monnieri</em>): Used to enhance memory and intellect.</li>
            <li><strong>Amalaki / Amla</strong> (<em>Emblica officinalis</em>): A rich source of Vitamin C; a potent *Rasayana*.</li>
            <li><strong>Haritaki</strong> (<em>Terminalia chebula</em>): Used for digestion and detoxification.</li>
            <li><strong>Neem</strong> (<em>Azadirachta indica</em>): Used for its antiseptic, antibacterial, and skin-purifying properties.</li>
            <li><strong>Tulsi</strong> (<em>Ocimum sanctum</em>): Used for cough, cold, and boosting immunity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic3">Methods of preparation of ayurvedic formulations</h2>
        <p>Ayurvedic medicines (<em>Aushadhi</em>) are prepared in specific ways to enhance their potency and shelf-life. This is known as *Bhaishajya Kalpana* (pharmaceutics).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Asava & Arishta (Fermented Liquids):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>These are medicinal wines, produced by <strong>fermentation</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Asava:</strong> Made from the fresh juice of herbs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Arishta:</strong> Made from a decoction (boiled extract) of herbs.</li>
                    <li>The self-generated alcohol acts as a preservative and helps in extracting the active principles.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Gutikas (Pills / Tablets):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Made by pounding herbal powders with a liquid (juice, decoction) to form a paste, which is then rolled into pills and dried.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Churna (Powders):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The simplest form. Dried herbs are finely powdered (individually or in combination) and sieved. (e.g., *Triphala churna*).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Lehya (Linctus / Herbal Jams):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Made by boiling decoctions with sugar or jaggery to form a thick, semi-solid consistency. Ghee or honey is often added. (e.g., *Chyawanprash*).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bhasmas (Calx / Ash):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A complex, specialized preparation involving minerals, metals, or gems.</li>
                    <li>The material is purified (<em>Shodhana</em>) and then incinerated (<em>Marana</em>) with herbal juices in special crucibles to create a fine, non-toxic, biologically active ash.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic4">Unani System of Medicine</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>History and Concept:</strong> Originated in <strong>Greece</strong>, founded by <strong>Hippocrates</strong>. It was developed and refined by Arab and Persian scholars like <strong>Avicenna (Ibn Sina)</strong>. It was introduced to India by the Arabs.</li>
            <li><strong>Core Principle (Anoor-e-tabiya):</strong> Based on the "Humoral Theory." It states that the body is composed of four <strong>"humors"</strong> (fluids):
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Dam</strong> (Blood) - Sanguine</li>
                    <li><strong>Balgham</strong> (Phlegm) - Phlegmatic</li>
                    <li><strong>Safra</strong> (Yellow Bile) - Choleric</li>
                    <li><strong>Sauda</strong> (Black Bile) - Melancholic</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Health is the state of perfect balance of these four humors. Disease is their imbalance. Treatment aims to restore this balance.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Anoor-e-tabiya (Arkan-e-Tabiya):</strong> This refers to the fundamental elements (similar to Ayurveda): Air, Water, Earth, and Fire. These elements form the humors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic5">Siddha System of Medicine</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Origine and Basis:</strong> The oldest medical system in India, originating in the <strong>Tamil</strong> culture of the Dravidian civilization. It is attributed to <strong>Agastya (Agathiyar)</strong>, a revered sage (Siddhar).</li>
            <li><strong>Core Principle:</strong> Like Ayurveda, it is based on the concept of <strong>five elements</strong> and <strong>three humors</strong> (known in Tamil as <em>Vatham</em>, <em>Pitham</em>, <em>Kapham</em>).</li>
            <li><strong>Unique Feature:</strong> Siddha medicine places a strong emphasis on <strong>iatrochemistry</strong> – the use of metals and minerals (especially mercury, sulfur, gold) converted into "bhasmas" for healing.</li>
            <li><strong>Plants Used:</strong> Utilizes many of the same plants as Ayurveda, such as <em>Amla</em>, <em>Neem</em>, and <em>Brahmi</em>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic6">Medical terms (summary)</h2>
