        <h2 id="topic1">Indoor gardening: Definition and suitable areas</h2>
        
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Indoor Gardening:</strong> The practice of growing plants inside buildings, such as in homes, offices, or malls. It involves growing plants in containers (like pots) rather than in the ground, in an environment where light, temperature, and humidity are different from the outdoors.
        </blockquote>
        <p>The primary purpose is aesthetic (decoration), but it is also known to improve indoor air quality and boost mental well-being.</p>
        
        <h3>Areas suitable for placing indoor plants</h3>
        <p>The "right plant for the right place" is the key. The location must match the plant's light needs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High Light Areas:</strong> (e.g., South-facing windows, sunny balconies). Suitable for flowering plants (like Hibiscus), succulents, and crotons.</li>
            <li><strong>Medium Light Areas:</strong> (e.g., East or West-facing windows, bright rooms). Suitable for a wide range of plants (e.g., Spider Plant, Snake Plant, Dracaena).</li>
            <li><strong>Low Light Areas:</strong> (e.g., North-facing windows, corners of rooms, hallways, bathrooms). Suitable for tough, shade-tolerant plants (e.g., Money Plant, ZZ Plant, Aglaonema).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic2">Factors affecting growth of indoor plants</h2>
        <p>The indoor environment is challenging for plants. The main limiting factors are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Light:</strong> This is the <strong>most critical factor</strong>. Light intensity drops dramatically with every foot you move away from a window. Plants must be chosen based on the available light. Insufficient light leads to "leggy" growth (etiolation).</li>
            <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Most indoor plants prefer stable temperatures (18°C - 24°C) that humans also like. They dislike sudden drafts from ACs/heaters or open doors.</li>
            <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Most homes (especially with AC or heating) are very <strong>dry</strong>. Most popular foliage plants are tropical and prefer high humidity.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Misting the leaves, grouping plants together, or using a humidifier.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Watering:</strong> <strong>Overwatering</strong> is the #1 cause of indoor plant death. It leads to root rot. Plants in pots need less water than plants in the ground, and their needs change with the season (less water in winter).</li>
            <li><strong>Potting Medium:</strong> Indoor plants need a sterile, lightweight, well-draining potting mix (as described in Unit 2 & 4), not heavy garden soil.</li>
            <li><strong>Container Size:</strong> The pot must have drainage holes. A pot that is too large can hold too much water and cause root rot. A pot that is too small restricts growth ("root-bound").</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="topic3">Pot plants and Foliage plants</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pot plants:</strong> A general term for any plant grown in a pot or container. This can include flowering plants, vegetables, or foliage plants.</li>
            <li><strong>Foliage plants:</strong> A specific type of pot plant that is grown primarily for its <strong>attractive leaves (foliage)</strong> rather than its flowers. The leaves may be colorful (e.g., *Croton*, *Aglaonema*), have interesting shapes (e.g., *Monstera*), or have unique textures. Most common indoor "houseplants" are foliage plants because they are adapted to the low-light conditions of a forest floor.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic4">Hanging Baskets</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Hanging Basket:</strong> A container (pot, wire basket, etc.) that is suspended from a hook, chain, or rope and used to grow plants, typically trailing or cascading species.
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Design:</strong> Wire baskets are lined with a <strong>liner</strong> (like coco coir) to hold the soil. Plastic or ceramic pots with built-in hangers are also used.</li>
            <li><strong>Suitable Plants:</strong> Plants with a trailing or "spilling" habit look best.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Money Plant (Pothos), Spider Plant, Ferns, Petunias.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Management:</strong> Hanging baskets <strong>dry out very quickly</strong> because they are exposed to air on all sides. They require frequent watering, often daily in hot weather.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic5">Terrariums</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Terrarium:</strong> A miniature, enclosed garden grown inside a <strong>sealable glass container</strong> (like a jar or a fish tank).
        </blockquote>
        <div class="placeholder">
            <strong>[Diagram: Labeled cross-section of a terrarium showing drainage layer, charcoal, soil, and plants]</strong>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Concept (Closed Terrarium):</strong> A closed terrarium creates its own self-sustaining micro-ecosystem.
                <ul>
                    <li>Plants release water vapor (transpiration), which condenses on the glass and "rains" back down, watering the plants.</li>
                    <li>Decomposing organic matter provides nutrients.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Construction:</strong> Built in layers:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Drainage Layer (bottom):</strong> Gravel or pebbles (to collect excess water).</li>
                    <li><strong>Charcoal Layer:</strong> A thin layer of activated charcoal (to keep the water "sweet" and prevent fungal growth).</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Layer:</strong> A layer of sterile potting mix.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plants:</strong> Small, humidity-loving plants are planted.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Suitable Plants:</strong> Must be high-humidity, low-light plants (e.g., Ferns, Mosses, Fittonia). <strong>Succulents should NOT be used</strong> in a closed terrarium (they will rot).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic6">Vertical gardens</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Vertical Garden (or Green Wall / Living Wall):</strong> A method of growing plants on a vertical surface, such as an interior or exterior wall.
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is a popular trend for urban areas, adding greenery to small spaces.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Technology:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pocket Systems:</strong> Fabric pockets (like a shoe organizer) are hung on a wall and filled with soil and plants.</li>
                    <li><strong>Modular Systems:</strong> A grid of interlocking plastic pots or panels is attached to the wall.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hydroponic Systems:</strong> Advanced systems where plants grow in a soil-less medium (like felt) and nutrient-rich water is circulated over the wall.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Requires a complex, automated <strong>drip irrigation</strong> system, as the panels dry out very fast.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic7">Bonsai</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Bonsai:</strong> The Japanese art of growing and training a tree or shrub in a shallow container, using techniques (pruning, wiring) to create a miniature, aged replica of a full-sized tree found in nature.
        </blockquote>
        <p>It is *not* a specific type of plant, but a *method* of growing. A "bonsai" is a "tree in a pot."</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Key Techniques:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Potting:</strong> Plants are grown in very shallow pots, which restricts root growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pruning:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Root Pruning:</strong> The tree is removed from the pot every 1-3 years, and a portion of its roots are pruned to keep it small.</li>
                            <li><strong>Branch Pruning:</strong> Branches are selectively pruned to create the desired shape (e.g., cascading, windswept).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Wiring:</strong> Young, flexible branches are wrapped with wire (copper or aluminum) to bend and set them into a desired position.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Suitable Plants:</strong> Woody perennials with small leaves and interesting bark (e.g., Ficus, Juniper, Pine, Maple).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic8">Plants suitable for indoor gardening</h2>
        <p>The best indoor plants are those that are tolerant of <strong>low light, irregular watering, and low humidity</strong>.</p>
