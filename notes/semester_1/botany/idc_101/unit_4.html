            <strong>Key Concept:</strong> Plant propagation is the process of creating new plants. It is divided into two main types:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Sexual Propagation:</strong> Using seeds (results in genetic variation).</li>
                <li><strong>Asexual (Vegetative) Propagation:</strong> Using parts of the parent plant like stems, roots, or leaves (e.g., cutting, layering). This creates a <strong>clone</strong>, an exact genetic copy of the parent.</li>
            </ol>
            This unit focuses on asexual (vegetative) methods.
        </div>

        <h2 id="topic1">Methods of plant propagation (Asexual/Vegetative)</h2>
        <p>These methods are used to create clones of a parent plant, preserving its desirable characteristics (e.g., a specific fruit flavor or flower color).</p>
        
        <h3 id="subtopic1-1">Cutting</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Cutting:</strong> A method where a piece of the parent plant (stem, root, or leaf) is cut off and induced to form its own roots, growing into a new plant.
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stem Cutting:</strong> The most common method. A piece of stem (4-6 inches) is cut, the lower leaves are removed, and it's placed in rooting media. Often, the cut end is dipped in <strong>rooting hormone (IBA)</strong>.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Rose, Bougainvillea, Hibiscus, Coleus, Money Plant.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Leaf Cutting:</strong> A leaf and its petiole (stalk) or just a piece of the leaf blade is used.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Snake Plant (<em>Sansevieria</em>), African Violet, Bryophyllum.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="subtopic1-2">Layering</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Layering:</strong> A method where roots are induced to form on a stem *while it is still attached to the parent plant*. The new, rooted stem is then detached.
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is a low-risk method because the new plant (layer) is supported by the parent until it has its own roots.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simple Layering:</strong> A low-lying, flexible branch is bent down to the ground, wounded (by making a small cut), and buried, leaving the tip exposed. Roots form at the wound.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Jasmine, Strawberry.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Air Layering (or Gootee):</strong> Used for woody plants that can't be bent to the ground.
                <ol>
                    <li>A section of bark (1-inch ring) is removed from a healthy, aerial branch.</li>
                    <li>The wound is dusted with rooting hormone.</li>
                    <li>A moist ball of <strong>sphagnum moss</strong> is wrapped around the wound.</li>
                    <li>The moss is covered with a plastic sheet, and the ends are tied.</li>
                    <li>Roots grow into the moss. The branch is then cut below the roots and potted.</li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Litchi, Guava, Croton, Ficus.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        </div>

        <h3 id="subtopic1-3">Budding</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Budding:</strong> A type of grafting where the <strong>scion</strong> (top part) is reduced to a single <strong>bud</strong> (with a small piece of bark).
        </blockquote>
        <p>This bud is inserted under the bark of the <strong>rootstock</strong> (base plant).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Method (T-Budding):</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>A T-shaped cut is made in the bark of the rootstock.</li>
                    <li>A "shield bud" (a bud with a shield-shaped piece of bark) is sliced from the scion plant.</li>
                    <li>The bud is inserted into the T-cut, and the flaps of bark are closed over it.</li>
                    <li>The union is wrapped tightly with grafting tape, leaving the bud exposed.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> This is the primary method for propagating <strong>Roses</strong> (budding a fancy rose onto a hardy wild rose rootstock) and citrus fruits (Orange, Lemon).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="subtopic1-4">Grafting</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Grafting:</strong> The art of joining the parts of two different plants (but usually related species) so that they will unite and grow as one.
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scion:</strong> The upper part, which is a small shoot (3-4 buds) from the desired variety (e.g., 'Alphonso' Mango).</li>
            <li><strong>Rootstock (or Stock):</strong> The lower part, which forms the root system (e.g., a hardy, native mango seedling).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> The <strong>cambium</strong> (a thin layer of dividing cells) of the scion must be in close contact with the cambium of the rootstock for the vascular tissues (xylem, phloem) to connect.</p>
        <p><strong>Uses:</strong> To propagate varieties that don't grow well from cuttings (like Mango, Apple), to get a strong root system, or to change the variety of an existing tree.</p>

        <h2 id="topic2">Seed structure and seed dormancy</h2>
        
        <h3>Seed Structure</h3>
        <p>A mature seed is a "baby plant in a box with its lunch." It consists of three main parts:</p>
        <div class="placeholder">
            <strong>[Diagram: Labeled structure of a Dicot seed (Bean) showing Testa, Cotyledons, and Embryo]</strong>
        </div>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Embryo:</strong> The young, diploid (2n) plant itself. It has:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plumule:</strong> The embryonic shoot (becomes the stem and leaves).</li>
                    <li><strong>Radicle:</strong> The embryonic root (becomes the primary root).</li>
                    <li><strong>Cotyledon(s):</strong> The seed leaves (one in monocots, two in dicots).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Endosperm (Food Supply):</strong> A starchy or oily tissue that provides food for the embryo. (In some seeds, like beans, the endosperm is absorbed by the cotyledons, which then become the food supply).</li>
            <li><strong>Seed Coat (Testa):</strong> The tough, outer, protective layer that guards the embryo and endosperm from drying out and from pests.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Seed Dormancy</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Seed Dormancy:</strong> A state in which a viable (living) seed will <strong>not germinate</strong> even when provided with the ideal conditions (water, oxygen, temperature) for germination.
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is a survival mechanism to ensure the seed only germinates at the *right time* (e.g., in spring, after a fire, after passing through an animal's gut).</p>
        <p><strong>Types of Dormancy (and how to break them):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physical Dormancy (Seed Coat Dormancy):</strong> Caused by a hard, waxy, or impermeable seed coat that prevents water and oxygen from entering.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Breaking it (Scarification):</strong> Nicking the seed with a file, rubbing with sandpaper, or soaking in acid or hot water to break the seed coat.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Chemical Dormancy:</strong> The seed contains chemical inhibitors (like abscisic acid) that prevent germination.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Breaking it (Leaching):</strong> Soaking the seed in running water to "wash out" the chemicals.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Physiological Dormancy:</strong> The embryo itself is immature or needs a "trigger."
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Breaking it (Stratification):</strong> Mimicking natural conditions. <strong>Cold Stratification</strong> involves mixing seeds with moist sand/peat and storing them in a cold (refrigerator) environment for several weeks. This "fools" the seed into thinking it has gone through winter. (Common for apples, cherries).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="topic3">Concept of plant growth regulators</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs) / Plant Hormones:</strong> Organic chemical messengers produced by the plant (in very low concentrations) that regulate its growth and development from germination to fruiting.
        </blockquote>
        <p>There are five major classes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Auxins (e.g., IAA):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary Role:</strong> Promotes cell elongation, apical dominance (top bud grows, side buds don't).</li>
                    <li><strong>Nursery Use:</strong> Synthetic auxins (<strong>IBA, NAA</strong>) are the main ingredients in <strong>"rooting hormone"</strong> powder used for cuttings.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Gibberellins (e.g., GA3):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary Role:</strong> Promotes stem elongation (causes "bolting"), seed germination, and fruit size.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nursery Use:</strong> Used to break seed dormancy and increase fruit size (e.g., grapes).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cytokinins (e.g., Zeatin):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary Role:</strong> Promotes cell division (cytokinesis) and shoot formation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nursery Use:</strong> Used extensively in plant <strong>tissue culture</strong> (micropropagation) to induce shoot multiplication.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Abscisic Acid (ABA):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary Role:</strong> The "stress hormone." Induces dormancy in seeds and buds; causes stomata to close during drought.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ethylene:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary Role:</strong> A gas hormone. Promotes fruit ripening and leaf abscission (falling).</li>
                    <li><strong>Nursery Use:</strong> Used commercially to ripen fruits (e.g., bananas) after transport.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2 id="topic4">Rooting media</h2>
        <p>This is the substrate used to root cuttings. It is different from potting soil. An ideal rooting medium must be <strong>sterile, well-aerated (high oxygen), and moist, but not soggy</strong>. It should provide *no* nutrients (this encourages roots to grow in search of food).</p>

        <h3>Potato (<em>Solanum tuberosum</em>)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Propagation:</strong> <strong>Asexual (Vegetative)</strong>. Grown from "seed potatoes," which are small tubers (or pieces of a tuber) that contain at least 1-2 "eyes" (buds).</li>
            <li><strong>Cultivation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Planted in trenches or furrows in cool weather.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Hilling":</strong> As the plant grows, soil is mounded up around the base of the stem. This is <strong>essential</strong> because the new tubers form on *stolons* (underground stems), and they must be kept in the dark (light turns them green and toxic).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Harvesting:</strong> Harvested when the plant's foliage turns yellow and dies back. Tubers are carefully dug up and "cured" (kept in a cool, dark, humid place) for a week to harden the skin for storage.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Tomato (<em>Solanum lycopersicum</em>)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Propagation:</strong> <strong>Sexual (by Seed)</strong>. Seeds are typically sown indoors (in a nursery) 6-8 weeks before the last frost.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultivation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Transplanting:</strong> Young seedlings are transplanted into the garden when the weather is warm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Staking/Training:</strong> Tomatoes are vines. They must be given <strong>support</strong> (a stake, cage, or trellis) to keep the plant and fruit off the ground, which prevents rot and disease.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pruning:</strong> (For indeterminate types) "Suckers" (new shoots at the base of leaves) are often pinched off to direct energy into fruit production.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Harvesting:</strong> Fruits are harvested when they are fully colored and firm. They can be harvested at the "breaker" stage (just starting to turn pink) and will ripen fully off the vine.</li>
        </ul>
