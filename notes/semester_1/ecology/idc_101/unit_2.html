            <h2>1. Definition, Structure, and Function</h2>
            
            <h3>Definition: Ecosystem</h3>
            <blockquote>
                An <strong>Ecosystem</strong> is a dynamic system of all the living organisms (<strong>biotic community</strong>) in a particular area, interacting with each other and with their non-living (<strong>abiotic</strong>) physical environment.
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>The term was coined by <strong>Arthur Tansley</strong> in 1935.</li>
                <li>It is the fundamental unit of ecology, focusing on the interactions that link living and non-living components.</li>
                <li>Examples: A pond, a forest, a desert, a fallen log.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ecosystem Structure</h3>
            <p>This refers to the "parts list" of the ecosystem; its static components.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Abiotic Components:</strong> The non-living parts (e.g., sunlight, temperature, water, soil, minerals).</li>
                <li><strong>Biotic Components:</strong> The living parts, organized by trophic (feeding) levels (e.g., producers, consumers, decomposers).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ecosystem Function</h3>
            <p>This refers to the "processes" and "jobs" that occur within the ecosystem.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Energy Flow:</strong> The one-way passage of energy (from the sun) through the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutrient Cycling:</strong> The circular movement of chemical elements (like carbon, nitrogen) between biotic and abiotic components.</li>
                <li><strong>Productivity:</strong> The rate at which biomass is created.</li>
                <li><strong>Decomposition:</strong> The breakdown of dead organic matter.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In short: <strong>Structure is the 'what', Function is the 'how'.</strong></p>

                <br>   a. "Producers (Autotrophs)" (e.g., Plants) - get energy from Sun.
                <br>   b. "Consumers (Heterotrophs)" (e.g., Animals) - get energy from Producers.
                <br>   c. "Decomposers (Saprotrophs)" (e.g., Fungi) - get energy from dead Producers & Consumers.
                <br>Decomposers break down matter into "Nutrient Pool" (abiotic), which Producers then use.

            <h3>Abiotic Components (Non-living)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climatic:</strong> Sunlight, temperature, precipitation (water), wind, humidity.</li>
                <li><strong>Edaphic:</strong> Soil, its pH, mineral composition, and texture.</li>
                <li><strong>Inorganic Substances:</strong> Water (H₂O), Carbon Dioxide (CO₂), Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Biotic Components (Living)</h3>
            <p>Based on their role in energy flow:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Producers (Autotrophs):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Self-feeders." They create their own food from inorganic substances.</li>
                        <li>Most are <strong>photoautotrophs</strong> (plants, algae) using sunlight for photosynthesis.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Consumers (Heterotrophs):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Other-feeders." They get energy by eating other organisms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Primary Consumers (Herbivores):</strong> Eat producers (e.g., rabbit, grasshopper).</li>
                        <li><strong>Secondary Consumers (Carnivores):</strong> Eat primary consumers (e.g., fox, frog).</li>
                        <li><strong>Tertiary Consumers:</strong> Eat secondary consumers (e.g., eagle, snake).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Decomposers (Saprotrophs):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They obtain energy by breaking down dead organic matter (<em>detritus</em>) from all trophic levels.</li>
                        <li>They are essential for <strong>recycling nutrients</strong> back into the soil for producers to use.</li>
                        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Bacteria and fungi.</li>

            <h2>3. Types of Ecosystem</h2>
            
            <h3>Terrestrial Ecosystem (Land-based)</h3>
            <p>These are ecosystems found on land. Their character is primarily determined by climate (temperature, rainfall) and dominant vegetation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Forest Ecosystem:</strong> Dominated by trees (e.g., tropical rainforest, temperate deciduous forest, taiga).</li>
                <li><strong>Grassland Ecosystem:</strong> Dominated by grasses (e.g., savanna, prairie, steppe).</li>
                <li><strong>Desert Ecosystem:</strong> Characterized by very low rainfall and sparse, adapted vegetation (e.g., hot desert like the Sahara, cold desert like the Gobi).</li>
                <li><strong>Tundra Ecosystem:</strong> A cold, treeless biome with a permanently frozen subsoil (permafrost).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Aquatic Ecosystem (Water-based)</h3>
            <p>These are ecosystems found in water bodies. They are often classified by salinity (salt content).</p>
            
            <h4>Freshwater Ecosystems (Low salt content)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lentic (Standing Water):</strong> Ponds, lakes.</li>
                <li><strong>Lotic (Flowing Water):</strong> Rivers, streams.</li>
                <li><strong>Wetlands:</strong> Areas where soil is saturated (e.g., marshes, swamps).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Marine Ecosystems (High salt content)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ocean Ecosystem:</strong> The vast open ocean, with zones based on depth and light.</li>
                <li><strong>Coral Reef:</strong> Highly diverse and productive shallow-water ecosystems built by coral animals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Estuarine Ecosystems (Brackish water)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Estuary:</strong> An area where a freshwater river meets the saltwater ocean. The mixing creates "brackish" water. These are extremely productive ecosystems, serving as "nurseries" for many fish and shellfish.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="ecological-levels">
            <h2>4. Concept of Species, Population and Community</h2>
            <p>These are the hierarchical levels of organization for the biotic components of an ecosystem.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Species:</strong> A group of similar organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. (e.g., a "Grey Wolf").</li>
                <li><strong>Population:</strong> A group of individuals of the <em>same species</em> living in the same area at the same time. (e.g., "The pack of Grey Wolves in Yellowstone Park").</li>
                <li><strong>Community:</strong> A group of <em>different populations</em> (all the different species) living and interacting in the same area. (e.g., "The Grey Wolves, elk, bison, and aspen trees in Yellowstone Park").</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Remember the hierarchy:</strong>
                <br>Individual Organism → <strong>Population</strong> (one species) → <strong>Community</strong> (many species) → <strong>Ecosystem</strong> (community + abiotic factors).

        <section id="energy-flow">
            <h2>5. Energy Flow in an Ecosystem</h2>
            <blockquote>
                The flow of energy in an ecosystem is <strong>UNIDIRECTIONAL (one-way)</strong>.
            </blockquote>
            <p>It does not cycle. It flows in, is transferred, and is eventually lost as heat.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Input:</strong> Virtually all energy for Earth's ecosystems comes from the <strong>sun</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Capture:</strong> Producers (plants) capture this solar energy via <strong>photosynthesis</strong> and store it in the chemical bonds of sugar (biomass).</li>
                <li><strong>Transfer:</strong> Energy is transferred to primary consumers when they eat producers, and then to secondary consumers when they eat primary consumers, and so on.</li>
                <li><strong>Loss:</strong> At each and every step, a large amount of energy (around <strong>90%</strong>) is <strong>lost</strong>. This energy is used for the organism's own metabolism (movement, breathing, keeping warm) and is ultimately dissipated as <strong>heat</strong>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This massive loss of energy at each step is known as the <strong>10% Law</strong> (only about 10% of energy is passed on). This is the second law of thermodynamics in action (entropy/disorder always increases).</p>

        <section id="food-chain-web">
            <h2>6. Food Chain and Food Web</h2>
            <p>These are models that show the flow of energy in an ecosystem.</p>
            
            <h3>Food Chain</h3>
            <p>A simple, linear pathway showing the feeding relationships and energy flow from one organism to another. Each step is a <strong>trophic level</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Example 1 (Terrestrial):</strong>
                    <br>Grass (Producer) → Grasshopper (Primary Consumer) → Frog (Secondary Consumer) → Snake (Tertiary Consumer)
                </li>
                <li><strong>Example 2 (Aquatic):</strong>
                    <br>Algae (Producer) → Zooplankton (Primary Consumer) → Small Fish (Secondary Consumer) → Large Fish (Tertiary Consumer)
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Food Web</h3>
            <p>A food web is a more realistic and complex model that shows the <strong>interconnected network of multiple food chains</strong> within a community. It recognizes that most organisms eat, and are eaten by, more than one species.</p>
            <p>Food webs are more <strong>stable</strong> than simple food chains. If one food source is removed (e.g., a disease kills all the rabbits), a fox (in a food web) can survive by eating more mice or squirrels.</p>

        <section id="pyramids">
            <h2>7. Ecological Pyramids</h2>
            <p>These are graphical representations of the trophic structure of an ecosystem. They show the relative amounts of a given quantity (energy, biomass, or numbers) at each successive trophic level. The producers always form the base (bottom level).</p>
            
            <h3>Pyramid of Energy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Shows the amount of <strong>energy</strong> (e.g., in Joules) available at each trophic level.</li>
                <li>It is <strong>ALWAYS UPRIGHT</strong>.</li>
                <li>This is because energy is always lost (as heat) at each transfer, following the 10% Law.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Pyramid of Biomass</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Shows the total <strong>biomass</strong> (total dry weight of all organisms) at each level.</li>
                <li><strong>Usually Upright:</strong> In most terrestrial ecosystems (like a forest), the total biomass of producers (trees) is vastly larger than the biomass of herbivores.</li>
                <li><strong>Can be Inverted:</strong> In some aquatic ecosystems. The producers are <strong>phytoplankton</strong>, which have a tiny total biomass but reproduce extremely rapidly. They are consumed so quickly by <strong>zooplankton</strong> that the zooplankton's biomass at any given moment is actually greater.</li>

            <h3>Pyramid of Numbers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Shows the <strong>number of individual organisms</strong> at each trophic level.</li>
                <li><strong>Usually Upright:</strong> In a grassland, there are millions of grass plants, thousands of grasshoppers, and a few birds.</li>
                <li><strong>Can be Inverted:</strong> When the producer is very large. For example, a <strong>single large tree</strong> (1 producer) can support thousands of insects (primary consumers).</li>

                <strong>Crucial Exam Point:</strong> The <strong>Pyramid of Energy is the only pyramid that is *always* upright.</strong> Pyramids of numbers and biomass can be inverted.

            <h2>8. Carrying Capacity: Definition</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Carrying Capacity (K)</strong> is defined as the <strong>maximum population size</strong> of a given species that a particular environment can <strong>sustain indefinitely</strong>, given the available food, water, and other resources.
            </blockquote>
            <p>It is not a fixed number, but a dynamic concept that can change if the environment changes (e.g., a drought would lower the carrying capacity).</p>
            <p>When a population grows, it eventually encounters <strong>limiting factors</strong> (like scarce food or increased disease), which cause the growth rate to slow down and stop. The population then typically fluctuates around this carrying capacity. This is shown by the <strong>logistic (S-shaped) growth curve</strong>.</p>
