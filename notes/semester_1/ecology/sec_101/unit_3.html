            <h2>1. Propagation of Bamboos (Traditional)</h2>
            <p>Propagation is the process of creating new bamboo plants. This can be done sexually (by seed) or asexually (vegetatively).</p>
            
            <h3>Propagation through Seeds</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Source:</strong> Collected during gregarious or sporadic flowering events.</li>
                <li><strong>Viability:</strong> Bamboo seed has a very <strong>short viability</strong> (lifespan), often just 1-3 months. It must be sown almost immediately.</li>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Produces a large number of plants; plants are genetically diverse.</li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Seeds are only available at very long, unpredictable intervals (40-120 years).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <hr>

        <section id="propagation-vegetative">
            <h2>2. Vegetative Propagation (Clonal)</h2>
            <p>This is the most common and practical method, as it doesn't rely on flowering. It produces "clones" that are genetically identical to the parent plant.</p>
            
            <h3>Offsets</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A traditional method. An "offset" is a 1-2 year old culm cut to 1-1.5m height, which is carefully dug up and separated from the mother clump *with its rhizome and roots intact*.</li>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> High survival rate if done correctly.</li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Very bulky, labor-intensive, and destructive to the mother clump. Only a few offsets can be taken from a clump.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Layering</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ground Layering:</strong> A whole, young culm is bent down and buried horizontally in the ground. Roots and shoots sprout from the nodes, and are later separated.</li>
                <li><strong>Air Layering (Marcotting):</strong> A ring of bark is removed from a node on a young culm, rooting hormone is applied, and it's wrapped in moist moss and plastic. Once roots form, the branch/culm is cut and planted.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Culm Cutting</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A highly effective "macro-propagation" technique. A 2-3 year old culm is cut into sections, each containing <strong>2-3 nodes</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Method:</strong> The cuttings are buried horizontally in a nursery bed (like a sugarcane sett) or planted vertically. Buds at the nodes sprout to form new shoots and roots.</li>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Can produce many plants from a single culm; less destructive than offset planting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Branch Culture (Branch Cuttings)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What it is:</strong> Uses the secondary branches from the culm as cuttings.</li>
                <li><strong>Method:</strong> Branches are cut, often trimmed, treated with rooting hormone (like IBA or NAA), and planted in a nursery bed or polybag, often under a mist system.</li>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> A single culm has hundreds of branches, so this method has a very high multiplication rate.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="infra">
            <h2>3. Infrastructure Facilities (Nursery)</h2>
            <p>A modern bamboo nursery requires specific facilities to protect young plants and maximize propagation success.</p>
            
            <h3>Concept of Green House</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A structure made of glass or transparent plastic.</li>
                <li><strong>Utility:</strong> It traps solar radiation, <strong>raising the internal temperature</strong>. Used to grow plants in cold climates or to protect tender seedlings from cold.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Concept of Net House (Shade House)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A structure covered with a "shade net" of a specific percentage (e.g., 50% or 75% shade).</li>
                <li><strong>Utility:</strong> It <strong>reduces the intensity of direct sunlight</strong> and lowers the temperature. This is crucial for "hardening" young, tender seedlings and protecting them from scorching.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Concept of Polyhouse</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A structure made of a metal frame covered in polyethylene (plastic) sheeting.</li>
                <li><strong>Utility:</strong> It is a simpler, cheaper version of a green house. It protects plants from rain, wind, and cold, and can be used to raise humidity (by adding a mist or fog system).</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Key Difference:</strong> A <strong>Green House</strong> is primarily for *heating* (trapping sun). A <strong>Net House</strong> is for *cooling* (providing shade). A <strong>Polyhouse</strong> is a versatile, low-cost protective structure.

            <h2>4. Nursery Bed Preparation and Potting Mixture</h2>
            
            <h3>Nursery Bed Preparation</h3>
            <p>These are beds where seeds are sown or cuttings are planted directly in the ground.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Raised Beds:</strong> Beds are typically raised 15-20 cm above the ground. This is the most important step, as it <strong>ensures good drainage</strong> and prevents "damping-off" (a fungal disease that kills seedlings in waterlogged soil).</li>
                <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> Usually 1 meter wide (for easy access from both sides) and 5-10 meters long.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Work:</strong> The soil is dug deep, and all stones and roots are removed.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Potting Mixture (Media)</h3>
            <p>This is the soil mix used to fill polybags or root trainers. A good mix must be porous, sterile, and nutritious.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Ideal Potting Mixture:</strong> A common ratio is <strong>1:1:1 of Soil : Sand : FYM (Farm Yard Manure)</strong>.
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Provides the mineral base.</li>
                <li><strong>Sand:</strong> Provides <strong>drainage and aeration</strong> (porosity). Coarse sand is best.</li>
                <li><strong>FYM/Compost/Vermicompost:</strong> Provides organic matter and essential nutrients.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For some cuttings, a "soilless" media like <strong>cocopeat</strong> (coconut husk fiber) is used, as it holds moisture well and is sterile.</p>

            <h2>5. Nursery Management</h2>
            <p>This involves all the day-to-day operations to keep the nursery plants healthy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> The most critical task. Young seedlings need light, frequent watering (e.g., with a fine rose-can). The soil should be kept moist, but <strong>never waterlogged</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Weeding:</strong> Weeds compete for water, nutrients, and light. They must be removed regularly, either by hand or with small tools.</li>
                <li><strong>Shading:</strong> Young seedlings and new cuttings are very tender. They must be protected from direct, harsh sunlight, usually by placing them in a net house or under a temporary shade structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest & Disease Control:</strong> Regularly inspect plants for signs of insects or fungi. "Damping-off" (seedlings rotting at the base) is the most common problem, controlled by ensuring good drainage and avoiding over-watering.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="training">
            <h2>6. Seedling Training and Management</h2>
            <p>This refers to the process of preparing a young plant (seedling) to survive in the harsh conditions of the final plantation site. This is also called <strong>"Hardening Off."</strong></p>
            
            <h3>Hardening Off Process:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Gradual Exposure:</strong> Seedlings grown in a protected nursery (polyhouse or net house) are soft. They are gradually moved to areas with more direct sunlight and less protection.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Watering:</strong> The frequency of watering is slowly reduced to get the plant accustomed to drier conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Pruning:</strong> If seedlings are in polybags, the bags are shifted to break any roots that have grown into the ground. If in beds, a spade is run underneath to cut the taproot, which encourages a more fibrous, compact root ball.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>A "hardened" plant has a stronger stem and a better-developed root system, and has a much higher survival rate after being transplanted to the field.</p>
