        <h2 id="topic1">Core Definitions</h2>

        <h3 id="sub1_1">Ecology</h3>
        <p>The term "Ecology" was coined by <strong>Ernst Haeckel</strong> in 1866 from the Greek words <em>Oikos</em> ("house" or "dwelling place") and <em>Logos</em> ("study of").</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> Ecology is the scientific study of the interactions between organisms and their environment, and how these interactions determine the distribution and abundance of organisms.
        </blockquote>
        <p>The "environment" includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Abiotic factors:</strong> Non-living components like temperature, water, sunlight, soil, salinity, and pH.</li>
            <li><strong>Biotic factors:</strong> Living components, including other organisms of the same species (intraspecific) and different species (interspecific), such as predators, prey, competitors, and parasites.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="sub1_2">Landscape</h3>
        <p>A landscape is a heterogeneous area composed of a cluster of interacting ecosystems that are repeated in a similar form throughout. It's a mosaic of different "patches."</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> A rural landscape might include patches of forest, farmland, a river, and a small village. Landscape ecology studies the flow of energy, materials, and organisms between these patches.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="sub1_3">Habitat</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> A habitat is the natural environment or "address" where an organism, population, or species lives.
        </blockquote>
        <p>It is characterized by its physical and chemical features (abiotic factors) and the other species living there (biotic factors). A habitat provides an organism with everything it needs to survive: food, water, shelter, and mates.</p>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Do not confuse <strong>Habitat</strong> with <strong>Niche</strong>.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Habitat</strong> is the organism's "address" (where it lives). <em>Example: The habitat of a polar bear is the Arctic sea ice.</em></li>
                <li><strong>Niche</strong> is the organism's "profession" or role (what it does, its functional role in the ecosystem, including its feeding habits and tolerance levels). <em>Example: The niche of a polar bear is a top predator that feeds on seals.</em></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 id="sub1_4">Ecotones</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> An ecotone is a transition zone between two or more different biological communities or ecosystems.
        </blockquote>
        <p>Ecotones are not sharp boundaries but gradual blending areas. They often have high species diversity because they contain species from both adjacent ecosystems, as well as species that are unique to the ecotone itself. This phenomenon is called the <strong>Edge Effect</strong> (covered in Unit 3).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The transition between a forest and a grassland (a meadow).</li>
                    <li>A marshland, which is an ecotone between terrestrial (land) and aquatic (water) ecosystems.</li>
                    <li>An estuary, which is an ecotone between freshwater (river) and marine (sea) ecosystems.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="sub1_5">Biosphere</h3>
        <p>The biosphere is the highest level of ecological organization. It is the global sum of all ecosystems.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> The biosphere is the part of the Earth where life exists, including all living organisms, from the deepest ocean trenches to the highest mountain peaks and into the atmosphere.
        </blockquote>
        <p>It is a relatively thin layer that includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lithosphere:</strong> The land (soil and rock).</li>
            <li><strong>Hydrosphere:</strong> The water (oceans, lakes, rivers).</li>
            <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> The air.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="sub1_6">Ecosystems</h3>
        <p>The term "Ecosystem" was coined by <strong>A.G. Tansley</strong> in 1935.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> An ecosystem is a functional unit of nature, comprising all the living organisms (biotic community) in a particular area interacting with their non-living physical environment (abiotic factors) and with each other.
        </blockquote>
        <p>Key features of an ecosystem:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Components:</strong> Abiotic (non-living) and Biotic (living).</li>
            <li><strong>Processes:</strong> Energy flow (usually unidirectional, from sun to producers to consumers) and Nutrient cycling (biogeochemical cycles, which are cyclical).</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> A pond, a forest, a desert, a coral reef, or even a drop of water.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic2">Ecosystem Stability</h2>
        <p>Ecosystem stability refers to the ability of an ecosystem to maintain its structure (e.g., species composition) and function (e.g., nutrient cycling) over time, especially in the face of disturbances.</p>
        
        <h3 id="sub2_1">Resistance and Resilience</h3>
        <p>Stability has two main components:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Resistance:</strong> The ability of an ecosystem to <strong>avoid displacement</strong> or change when faced with a disturbance. A highly resistant ecosystem changes very little when a disturbance (like a fire or drought) occurs.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> A mature tropical rainforest is highly resistant to small-scale disturbances due to its complex structure and high biodiversity.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> The ability of an ecosystem to <strong>recover quickly</strong> and return to its original state after being disturbed.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> A grassland is not very resistant to fire (it burns easily), but it is extremely resilient and grows back quickly, often within weeks or months.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Key Concept:</strong> There is often a trade-off between resistance and resilience. Ecosystems with high resistance (like complex forests) often have low resilience (they take centuries to grow back if clear-cut). Ecosystems with low resistance (like simple grasslands) often have high resilience.
        </div>

        <h2 id="topic3">Branches of Ecology</h2>
        
        <h3 id="sub3_1">Autecology</h3>
        <p>Also known as <strong>Species Ecology</strong>.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> Autecology is the branch of ecology that studies the interactions of an <strong>individual organism or a single species</strong> with its environment.
        </blockquote>
        <p>It focuses on the physiological, morphological, and behavioral adaptations of a species to its surroundings.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example Study:</strong> "How does temperature (an abiotic factor) affect the germination rate of a specific plant species?" or "The life cycle and habitat requirements of the Bengal Tiger."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="sub3_2">Synecology</h3>
        <p>Also known as <strong>Community Ecology</strong>.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> Synecology is the branch of ecology that studies the interactions between <strong>groups of organisms (like communities or ecosystems)</strong> and their environment.
        </blockquote>
        <p>It focuses on the composition, structure, and development of communities.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example Study:</strong> "How do predator-prey interactions between lions and wildebeest affect the grassland community?" or "The study of species diversity and succession in a forest ecosystem."</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic4">Major Terrestrial Biomes</h2>
        <p>Biomes are very large ecological areas on the Earth's surface, with fauna and flora (animals and plants) adapting to their environment. They are primarily defined by their <strong>climate (temperature and precipitation)</strong> and <strong>dominant vegetation</strong>.</p>

        <h2 id="topic5">Limiting Factors and Tolerance</h2>

        <h3 id="sub5_1">Ecological Amplitude</h3>
        <p>This refers to the <strong>range of tolerance</strong> an organism has for a particular environmental factor (e.g., temperature, salinity, pH).
        <ul>
            <li>Species with a <strong>wide</strong> ecological amplitude for a factor (e.g., can tolerate a wide range of temperatures) are called <strong>eurythermal</strong>. They are often widely distributed.
            <li>Species with a <strong>narrow</strong> ecological amplitude (e.g., can only tolerate a very specific temperature range) are called <strong>stenothermal</strong>. They often have a limited, specialized distribution.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A pigeon (eury- species) can be found in many climates, while a penguin (steno- species) is restricted to cold regions.</p>

        <h3 id="sub5_2">Liebig's Law of the Minimum</h3>
        <p>Proposed by <strong>Justus von Liebig</strong>, a soil chemist.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Law:</strong> The growth and distribution of a species are controlled not by the total resources available, but by the <strong>scarcest resource</strong> (the "limiting factor").
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is often visualized as a "Liebig's barrel," where the staves (planks) of the barrel represent different nutrients. The barrel can only be filled as high as the <strong>shortest stave</strong> (the limiting nutrient), no matter how high the other staves are.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Plant growth in an ecosystem may be limited by the availability of phosphate, even if nitrogen, water, and sunlight are abundant. Adding more nitrogen will not increase growth; only adding phosphate will.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="sub5_3">Shelford's Law of Tolerance</h3>
        <p>An expansion of Liebig's Law, proposed by <strong>Victor Shelford</strong>.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Law:</strong> The success of an organism is determined by a range of conditions (tolerance range) for each environmental factor. There is not only a <strong>minimum</strong> requirement but also a <strong>maximum</strong> tolerance.
        </blockquote>
        <p>For any factor (e.g., temperature), an organism has:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Optimum Range:</strong> The level at which the organism functions best and is most abundant.</li>
            <li><strong>Zones of Stress:</strong> Ranges above and below the optimum where the organism can survive but is under stress (e.g., lower reproduction, slower growth).</li>
            <li><strong>Zones of Intolerance:</strong> The extremes (too high or too low) beyond which the organism cannot survive.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="topic6">Ecological Variations</h2>
        <p>These terms describe how species and communities vary in response to environmental gradients.</p>

        <h3 id="sub6_1">Ecoclines</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> An ecocline is a gradual, continuous change in the species composition and environmental factors along a transect or environmental gradient.
        </blockquote>
        <p>It is a gradient of communities, not a sharp boundary.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> The gradual change in vegetation as you move up a mountain (from deciduous forest at the base, to coniferous forest, to alpine tundra at the peak) due to the gradients of temperature and air pressure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="sub6_2">Ecotypes</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> An ecotype is a genetically distinct population of a species that is adapted to a specific set of local environmental conditions.
        </blockquote>
        <p>Ecotypes of the same species can look different and have different physiological tolerances, but they can still interbreed (though they may be geographically isolated).
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> A plant species that grows on both sunny, dry slopes and in shady, moist valleys. The slope population may be shorter with deeper roots (an ecotype adapted to drought), while the valley population is taller with shallower roots (an ecotype adapted to shade). These are <strong>genetic adaptations</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="sub6_3">Ecades (or Ecophenes)</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> An ecade (or ecophene) refers to the phenotypic (physical) variations in an organism caused directly by environmental conditions, <em>without</em> any genetic change.
        </blockquote>
        <p>If you take an ecade and move it to a different environment, it (or its offspring) will change to match the new conditions. This is <strong>phenotypic plasticity</strong>, not genetic evolution.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> A <em>Dandelion</em> plant growing in a sunny lawn may be short and flat, while the *exact same plant* (if transplanted) growing in a shaded, protected area will grow tall and leafy. The genetic makeup is identical; only the physical expression has changed.</li>
        </ul>

            <strong>Key Distinction for Exams:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ecotype:</strong> Genetic, inherited adaptation (Nature). Forms a distinct population.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecade/Ecophene:</strong> Phenotypic, non-inherited response (Nurture). An individual's flexibility.</li>
