        <h2 id="topic1">Concept of workshop practice</h2>
        <p>A <strong>workshop</strong> is a place where manufacturing and repair of goods take place. <strong>Workshop practice</strong> is the study and application of the skills, tools, and processes required to make or repair objects, typically from materials like metal, wood, or plastic.</p>
        <p>It provides the fundamental "hands-on" knowledge needed by engineers and technicians.</p>
        <h3>Core Objectives of Workshop Practice:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Learning to operate tools and machinery safely is the primary objective. This includes wearing proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) like safety glasses, gloves, and boots.</li>
            <li><strong>Tool Familiarity:</strong> Understanding the name, function, and correct use of various hand tools (e.g., files, hammers, saws, wrenches) and machine tools (e.g., lathes, drills).</li>
            <li><strong>Material Knowledge:</strong> Learning to identify different materials (like steel, aluminum, copper, wood) and understanding their properties (e.g., hardness, brittleness).</li>
            <li><strong>Process Knowledge:</strong> Learning the basic manufacturing processes like measuring, marking, cutting, shaping, joining (welding, soldering), and finishing (filing, painting).</li>
            <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Developing the skill to create a component that matches a given technical drawing and its specified dimensions (specifications).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic2">Overview of manufacturing methods</h2>
        <p><strong>Manufacturing</strong> is the process of converting raw materials into finished goods. There are several primary methods:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Casting (and Foundry)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Foundry:</strong> The workshop where casting is done.</li>
            <li><strong>Casting:</strong> This is a <strong>shaping process</strong>.
                <ol>
                    <li>A <strong>pattern</strong> (a model of the desired object) is made, often from wood.</li>
                    <li>This pattern is pressed into special, moist sand to create a <strong>mould</strong> (a hollow cavity).</li>
                    <li>The pattern is removed.</li>
                    <li>Molten (liquid) metal is poured into the mould.</li>
                    <li>The metal cools and solidifies, taking the shape of the mould.</li>
                    <li>The sand mould is broken, and the finished metal <strong>casting</strong> is removed.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Use:</strong> For creating complex shapes that would be difficult to machine. (e.g., engine blocks, manhole covers, lamp posts).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Forging</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Description:</strong> This is a <strong>shaping process</strong> that uses compressive forces (hammering or pressing) to shape metal, usually when it is hot.</li>
            <li><strong>Process:</strong> It's like a blacksmith with a hammer and anvil. A metal billet is heated until it is "plastic" (soft but not liquid) and then hammered or squeezed into the desired shape.</li>
            <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> Forging refines the internal grain structure of the metal, making the final part extremely <strong>strong and durable</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Use:</strong> For high-strength parts. (e.g., wrenches, crane hooks, connecting rods in an engine).</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic3">Specifications and Identifications of Components</h2>
        
        <h3>Specifications of components</h3>
        <p>A <strong>specification</strong> (or "spec") is a detailed description of a component's required properties. This is found on a technical drawing or in a manual. It removes all ambiguity and ensures the part is made correctly.</p>
        <p>Key specifications include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> Length, width, height, diameter. (e.g., "M8 bolt, 50mm long").</li>
            <li><strong>Tolerances:</strong> The acceptable range of variation for a dimension. (e.g., "diameter = 10.00 ± 0.05 mm" means the part is acceptable if its diameter is between 9.95 mm and 10.05 mm).</li>
            <li><strong>Material:</strong> What it's made of (e.g., "Stainless Steel 304").</li>
            <li><strong>Finish:</strong> The required surface texture (e.g., "polished," "matte," "painted").</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Identifications of nuts, bolts, screws, etc.</h3>
        <p>These are common "fasteners" used to join components.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bolt:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Description:</strong> A fastener with external (male) threads. It has a "head" on one end and is threaded on the other.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use:</strong> A bolt is designed to pass *through* unthreaded holes in two components and is secured on the other side by a <strong>nut</strong>. It joins things by "clamping" them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Head types:</strong> Hexagonal (most common), square, round.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Nut:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Description:</strong> A block (usually hexagonal) with internal (female) threads.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use:</strong> Mates with a bolt to fasten components together.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Screw:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Description:</strong> A fastener with external threads, similar to a bolt.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use:</strong> A screw is designed to be inserted into a <strong>threaded hole</strong> in one of the components (or to cut its own threads, as in a wood screw). It typically does *not* use a nut.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Key Difference (Bolt vs. Screw):</strong>
            <br>
            A <strong>bolt</strong> passes through and is secured by a <strong>nut</strong>.
            <br>
            A <strong>screw</strong> threads *into* one of the components.

        <h2 id="topic4">Commonly used materials for manufacturing</h2>
        
        <h3>Metals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Steel:</strong> An <strong>alloy</strong> of iron and a small amount of carbon.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Very strong, durable, versatile.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use:</strong> The backbone of construction, cars, tools, and machinery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stainless Steel</strong> is a type of steel alloyed with chromium, which makes it highly resistant to rust. (Use: Kitchen sinks, cutlery, medical instruments).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Iron:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Heavy, strong but brittle (if cast).</li>
                    <li><strong>Use:</strong> Often as "cast iron" (high carbon content) for heavy, vibration-damping machine bases, pipes, and cookware (e.g., frying pans).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Copper:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Excellent electrical conductor, excellent heat conductor, ductile (can be drawn into wires), resists corrosion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use:</strong> Electrical wiring, water pipes, motors, pots and pans.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Metal Sheets:</strong> This is a *form* of metal, not a type. It is metal (often steel or aluminum) that has been rolled flat. (Use: Car bodies, appliance housings, roofing).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Alloys</h3>
        <p>An <strong>alloy</strong> is a metal made by combining two or more metallic elements to produce new, improved properties (e.g., strength, lightness, corrosion resistance).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Steel</strong> (Iron + Carbon) - already discussed.</li>
            <li><strong>Brass</strong> (Copper + Zinc) - Used for decorative hardware, musical instruments, plumbing fittings.</li>
            <li><strong>Bronze</strong> (Copper + Tin) - Used for statues, bearings, ship propellers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Plastics</h3>
        <p><strong>Plastics</strong> (or polymers) are synthetic materials.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Lightweight, low cost, easily moulded, waterproof, good electrical insulators.</li>
            <li><strong>Use:</strong> Ubiquitous. (e.g., bottles, bags, electronic casings, toys, car interiors).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Composites</h3>
        <p>A <strong>composite</strong> is a material made from two or more different materials that, when combined, are stronger or better than the individual components.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example 1: Fiberglass.</strong> Made from a plastic (polyester resin) reinforced with fine fibres of glass.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Lightweight, strong, stiff, can be moulded into complex shapes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use:</strong> Boat hulls, car bodies, water tanks.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Example 2: Carbon Fibre.</strong> Plastic resin reinforced with extremely strong carbon fibres.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Extremely strong, stiff, and very lightweight.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use:</strong> High-performance applications like racing cars, aircraft, and high-end bicycles.</li>
                </ul>
