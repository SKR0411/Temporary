            <h2>Galaxy and Milky Way</h2>
            
            <h3>What is a Galaxy?</h3>
            <blockquote>
                A <strong>Galaxy</strong> is a massive, gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants (like black holes and neutron stars), interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter.
            </blockquote>
            <p>Galaxies come in different shapes: spiral (like ours), elliptical, and irregular.</p>

            <h3>The Milky Way: Our Galaxy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Formed from the collapse of giant clouds of gas and dust shortly after the Big Bang, approximately 13.6 billion years ago.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Properties:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Type:</strong> It is a <strong>Barred Spiral Galaxy</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Size:</strong> Approximately 100,000 light-years across.</li>
                        <li><strong>Contents:</strong> Contains 100-400 billion stars.</li>
                        <li><strong>Our Location:</strong> Our Solar System is <em>not</em> at the center. We are located in one of the minor spiral arms (the <strong>Orion Arm</strong>), about 27,000 light-years from the galactic center.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </section>

        <section id="topic2">
            <h2>Asteroids</h2>
            
            <h3>Origin</h3>
            <p>Asteroids are rocky, airless remnants (<strong>planetesimals</strong>) left over from the early formation of our solar system 4.6 billion years ago. They are essentially "failed planets" that were prevented from clumping together to form a large planet by the immense gravitational pull of nearby Jupiter.</p>

            <h3>Composition</h3>
            <p>They are classified based on their composition (what they are made of):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>C-type (Chondrite):</strong> Most common. Composed of clay and silicate rocks. Dark in appearance.</li>
                <li><strong>S-type (Stony):</strong> Composed of silicate materials (rocky) and nickel-iron.</li>
                <li><strong>M-type (Metallic):</strong> Composed of nickel-iron. These are thought to be the cores of larger, differentiated planetesimals that were shattered.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most asteroids are found in the <strong>Main Asteroid Belt</strong>, a region of space between the orbits of <strong>Mars and Jupiter</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Meteorites</h2>

            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Key Definitions</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Meteoroid:</strong> A small rock or debris (from an asteroid or comet) floating in space.</li>
                    <li><strong>Meteor:</strong> The bright streak of light (a "shooting star") seen when a meteoroid enters Earth's atmosphere and burns up due to friction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Meteorite:</strong> The actual piece of rock that *survives* the journey and lands on Earth's surface.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Origin and Geological History</h3>
            <p>Meteorites are fragments of other celestial bodies. They can come from:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Asteroids:</strong> The vast majority of meteorites are pieces of asteroids.</li>
                <li><strong>Planets:</strong> We have found meteorites that were blasted off of <strong>Mars</strong> and the <strong>Moon</strong> by large impacts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Geological History:</strong> Meteorites are our most valuable "fossils" of the early solar system. Many (the chondrites) are <strong>primitive</strong>, unchanged samples of the original solar nebula, allowing us to date the age of the solar system (4.6 billion years) and know its starting chemical composition.</p>

            <h3>Classification and Composition</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Stones (or Stony Meteorites):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Composed of silicate minerals (like rock on Earth).</li>
                        <li><strong>Chondrites:</strong> The most common type. They are primitive and are defined by <strong>chondrules</strong>—small, spherical grains that were "flash-melted" in the solar nebula.</li>
                        <li><strong>Achondrites:</strong> Igneous rocks from space (e.g., basalts). They come from differentiated (melted) asteroids or planets.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Irons (Iron Meteorites):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Composed almost entirely of <strong>iron-nickel alloy</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Origin:</strong> They are the metallic <strong>cores</strong> of large, ancient planetesimals that were shattered by collisions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Stony-Irons:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Composition:</strong> A mix of silicate minerals and iron-nickel metal. They represent the "core-mantle boundary" of a shattered planetesimal.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Lunar (Moon) Geology</h2>
            
            <h3>Origin of the Moon</h3>
            <p>The leading theory is the <strong>Giant-Impact Hypothesis</strong>.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>About 4.5 billion years ago, the very young Earth was struck by a Mars-sized object named <strong>"Theia"</strong>.</li>
                <li>The cataclysmic impact ejected a massive amount of debris (mostly from the mantles of both Earth and Theia) into orbit around Earth.</li>
                <li>This ring of debris quickly tiny-img{width:20px} (stuck together) under its own gravity to form the Moon.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Lunar Surface Environment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Atmosphere:</strong> The Moon has no air, which means...
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is no weather, wind, or erosion.</li>
                        <li>The sky is always black.</li>
                        <li>Temperatures are extreme (from >120°C in sunlight to <-150°C in shadow).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Regolith:</strong> The entire surface is covered in a thick blanket of fine, grey dust and pulverized rock called <strong>regolith</strong>, formed by billions of years of micro-meteorite impacts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Lunar Features and Rocks</h3>
            <p>The Moon's surface has two main, distinct regions:</p>
            
            <h4>1. Lunar Highlands (Terrae)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> The bright, light-colored, rugged, and heavily cratered regions.</li>
                <li><strong>Lunar Rocks:</strong> Composed of a light-colored, low-density igneous rock called <strong>Anorthosite</strong> (made mostly of feldspar).</li>
                <li><strong>Age:</strong> Very old (4.0 - 4.5 billion years). They represent the Moon's original crust.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Lunar Maria (singular: Mare)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Origin:</strong> "Maria" means "seas" (Latin), but they are *not* bodies of water.</li>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> The dark, smooth, flat plains that make up the "face" of the Man in the Moon.</li>
                <li><strong>Lunar Rocks:</strong> ComPOSTed of a dark, dense volcanic rock: <strong>Basalt</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Origin:</strong> They are giant impact basins (craters) that were later flooded by lava (magma) from the Moon's mantle, which then cooled.</li>
                <li><strong>Age:</strong> Younger than the highlands (3.0 - 3.8 billion years).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Lunar Craters</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Formed almost exclusively by the impact of asteroids and meteoroids.</li>
                <li>Because the Moon has no atmosphere or erosion, craters are perfectly preserved, providing a record of impacts over billions of years.</li>
            </ul>
