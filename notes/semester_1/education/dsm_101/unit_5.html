        <h2 id="topic1">1. Meaning and Nature of Intelligence</h2>

        <h3>Meaning of Intelligence</h3>
        <p>Intelligence is one of the most debated concepts in psychology. It is not just "book smarts."</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>David Wechsler:</strong> "Intelligence is the aggregate or global capacity of the individual to <strong>act purposefully</strong>, to <strong>think rationally</strong>, and to <strong>deal effectively</strong> with his environment."
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>In simple terms, intelligence is the ability to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Learn from experience.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Solve problems.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Adapt to new situations.</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Nature of Intelligence</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It is an abstract concept; you cannot see or hold it, only infer it from behavior.</li>
            <li>It is a <strong>global capacity</strong> (aggregate), meaning it is made up of many different, related abilities.</li>
            <li>It is influenced by <em>both</em> <strong>Heredity (Nature)</strong> and <strong>Environment (Nurture)</strong>.</li>
            <li>It is culture-dependent (what is "smart" in one culture may be different in another).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic2">2. Factors influencing growth and development of intelligence</h2>
        <p>This is the classic <strong>"Nature vs. Nurture"</strong> debate.</p>
        
        <h3>1. Heredity (Nature)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Heredity sets the <strong>genetic potential</strong> or the <strong>upper limit</strong> of an individual's intelligence.</li>
            <li>This is supported by:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Twin Studies:</strong> Identical (monozygotic) twins raised in different homes still show a very high correlation in their IQ scores.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adoption Studies:</strong> A child's IQ is often more similar to their biological parents than their adoptive parents.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Environment (Nurture)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Environment determines <strong>how much</strong> of that genetic potential is actually achieved.</li>
            <li>Key environmental factors include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Severe malnutrition in early childhood can stunt brain development.</li>
                    <li><strong>Family/Home Environment:</strong> A stimulating home with books, conversation, and responsive parents is crucial.</li>
                    <li><strong>Education:</strong> Formal schooling has a strong positive effect on intelligence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Socio-Economic Status (SES):</strong> Higher SES is linked to better nutrition, healthcare, and educational opportunities.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Heredity provides the "blueprint" for the house, but environment provides the "materials and construction" that determine the final quality of the house.
        </div>

        <h2 id="topic3">3. Theories of Intelligence</h2>

        <h3>Spearman's Two-Factor Theory</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Theorist:</strong> Charles Spearman.</li>
            <li><strong>Core Idea:</strong> Intelligence is made of two factors:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>'g' factor (General Intelligence):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is a common, underlying mental energy or power that is present in *all* intellectual tasks.</li>
                            <li>It is innate (hereditary).</li>
                            <li>A person with a high 'g' will tend to do well in all areas (e.g., math, language, music).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>'s' factors (Specific Intelligences):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>These are specific abilities required for *particular* tasks (e.g., 's1' for math, 's2' for art, 's3' for vocabulary).</li>
                            <li>These are learned from the environment.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>In short:</strong> Your performance on any task = 'g' + 's' (for that task).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Thurstone's Theory of Primary Mental Abilities (PMA)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Theorist:</strong> L. L. Thurstone.</li>
            <li><strong>Core Idea:</strong> Thurstone <strong>rejected Spearman's 'g' factor</strong>. He argued that intelligence is not a single factor but a cluster of <strong>seven independent "Primary Mental Abilities."</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The 7 PMAs:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>V</strong> - Verbal Comprehension (vocabulary, understanding)</li>
                    <li><strong>W</strong> - Word Fluency (thinking of words quickly)</li>
                    <li><strong>N</strong> - Number Facility (speedy, accurate calculation)</li>
                    <li><strong>S</strong> - Spatial Visualization (visualizing space and shapes)</li>
                    <li><strong>M</strong> - Associative Memory (rote memorization)</li>
                    <li><strong>P</strong> - Perceptual Speed (seeing details and differences quickly)</li>
                    <li><strong>R</strong> - Reasoning (logical thinking)</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mnemonic:</strong> <strong>V</strong>ery <strong>W</strong>ise <strong>N</strong>arwhals <strong>S</strong>wim <strong>M</strong>ajestically <strong>P</strong>ast <strong>R</strong>eefs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Guilford's Structure of Intellect (SOI) Model</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Theorist:</strong> J. P. Guilford.</li>
            <li><strong>Core Idea:</strong> A complex, <strong>three-dimensional model</strong> of intelligence, like a "Rubik's Cube." He argued there are many, many factors, not just one or seven.</li>
            <li><strong>The 3 Dimensions:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Operations (What you do - 5 types):</strong> The mental processes (e.g., Cognition, Memory, Divergent Production, Convergent Production).</li>
                    <li><strong>Contents (What you think about - 4 types):</strong> The type of information (e.g., Figural, Symbolic, Semantic, Behavioral).</li>
                    <li><strong>Products (The results - 6 types):</strong> The form the information takes (e.g., Units, Classes, Relations, Systems).</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Total Abilities:</strong> Originally 5 x 4 x 6 = <strong>120 abilities</strong>. (This model was later expanded to 150+).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic4">4. Creativity</h2>

        <h3>Meaning and Characteristics of Creativity</h3>
        <p>Creativity is the ability to produce ideas or products that are both <strong>novel (new/original)</strong> and <strong>useful (appropriate/adaptive)</strong>.</p>
        
        <h4>Characteristics of a Creative Person:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fluency:</strong> Can produce a <em>large number</em> of ideas.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Can think from <em>different perspectives</em> and switch approaches.</li>
            <li><strong>Originality:</strong> Can produce ideas that are <em>unique and uncommon</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Elaboration:</strong> Can <em>add details</em> to an idea to make it complete.</li>
            <li><strong>Divergent Thinking:</strong> (A key concept from Guilford) The ability to think in many different directions and generate multiple solutions to an open-ended problem. This is often contrasted with <strong>Convergent Thinking</strong> (finding the single correct answer, as in an IQ test).</li>
            <li><strong>Other traits:</strong> High curiosity, independence, non-conformity, high intrinsic motivation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Intelligence vs. Creativity:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>They are related, but not the same.</li>
                <li>You need a certain *minimum* level of intelligence to be creative.</li>
                <li>But beyond that, high intelligence does not guarantee high creativity.</li>
                <li>Intelligence = Convergent Thinking; Creativity = Divergent Thinking.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Factors and Educational Implication</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Factors:</strong> Both heredity and environment play a role. A stimulating, open, and encouraging environment is key.</li>
            <li><strong>Educational Implication:</strong> The teacher's job is to <strong>foster creativity</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Development, Identification, and Fostering Creativity</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Identification:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use tests of divergent thinking (e.g., "How many uses can you think of for a brick?").</li>
                    <li>Observe students: Who is always curious? Who asks unusual questions? Who tries non-standard solutions?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Fostering Creativity (How to teach it):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Brainstorming:</strong> Encourage all ideas, no matter how wild. Defer judgment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Open-Ended Questions:</strong> Ask "What if...?" or "How could we...?" instead of "What is...?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Value Originality:</strong> Reward creative ideas, not just the "right answer."</li>
                    <li><strong>Provide a Safe Atmosphere:</strong> Students must feel safe to take risks and make mistakes without being ridiculed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Encourage Hobbies:</strong> Promote creative arts, music, and writing.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="topic5">5. Intelligence Quotient (IQ)</h2>

        <h3>Meaning and Calculation of IQ</h3>
        <p>IQ, or Intelligence Quotient, is a <strong>score</strong> derived from a standardized test, intended to measure a person's intelligence relative to their age group.</p>
        
        <h4>Calculation (The Ratio IQ formula):</h4>
        <p>This formula was developed by <strong>William Stern</strong> and used in the Stanford-Binet test.</p>
        <div class="formula">
            IQ = (Mental Age / Chronological Age) x 100
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mental Age (MA):</strong> The level of intellectual performance for a typical child of a certain age. (e.g., A 6-year-old who can solve problems that most 8-year-olds can solve has an MA of 8).</li>
            <li><strong>Chronological Age (CA):</strong> The person's actual, biological age.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> A child who is <strong>10</strong> years old (CA) but has a Mental Age of <strong>12</strong>:
                <br>IQ = (12 / 10) x 100 = <strong>120</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Modern IQ:</strong> This formula is no longer used for adults. Modern tests (like the Wechsler scales) use a <strong>"Deviation IQ"</strong> where the average score for any age group is set at 100, and scores are based on a normal distribution (bell curve).
        </div>

        <h3>IQ Classification</h3>
