        <h2 id="topic1">1. Meaning of Personality</h2>
        <p>The word "Personality" comes from the Latin word <strong>'persona'</strong>, which means 'mask' (the mask worn by actors in ancient Greek theatre).</p>
        <p>In common terms, personality refers to one's physical appearance. But in psychology, it is a much broader concept.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Gordon Allport's Definition:</strong> "Personality is the <strong>dynamic organization</strong> within the individual of those <strong>psychophysical systems</strong> that determine his <strong>unique adjustment</strong> to his environment."
        </blockquote>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"Dynamic Organization":</strong> Personality is not static; it is always growing and changing.</li>
            <li><strong>"Psychophysical Systems":</strong> It is a combination of mind (psycho) and body (physical).</li>
            <li><strong>"Determine":</strong> Our personality is what *causes* our behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>"Unique Adjustment":</strong> Every person's way of dealing with the world is unique.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In simple terms, personality is the <strong>unique and relatively stable pattern of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors</strong> that characterizes an individual.</p>

        <h2 id="topic2">2. Theories of Personality (Trait and Type)</h2>
        <p>These theories try to explain the structure of personality.</p>
        
        <h3>Type Theories</h3>
        <p>These theories attempt to classify people into distinct, separate <strong>categories or "types."</strong></p>
        
        <h4>Carl Jung's Type Theory:</h4>
        <p>Jung classified people based on their <strong>social attitude</strong>:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Type</th>
                    <th>Characteristics</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Introvert</strong></td>
                    <td>- Shy, reserved, keeps to themselves.<br>- Gets energy from being alone.<br>- Prefers solitary activities (e.g., reading).<br>- Thinks before speaking.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Extrovert</strong></td>
                    <td>- Outgoing, sociable, talkative.<br>- Gets energy from being with others.<br>- Prefers social gatherings.<br>- Speaks before thinking.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><em>(Note: Jung also proposed 'Ambivert' for people in the middle, but Introvert/Extrovert are the main two.)</em></p>
        
        <h4>Sheldon's Type Theory (Somatotypes):</h4>
        <p>Sheldon classified people based on their <strong>body build (soma)</strong>, linking it to temperament:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Body Type (Somatotype)</th>
                    <th>Temperament (Personality)</th>
                    <th>Characteristics</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Endomorph</strong></td>
                    <td>Viscerotonia</td>
                    <td>- Soft and round body (fat).<br>- Sociable, relaxed, fun-loving, loves food.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Mesomorph</strong></td>
                    <td>Somatotonia</td>
                    <td>- Muscular and athletic body.<br>- Active, assertive, aggressive, loves risk.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Ectomorph</strong></td>
                    <td>Cerebrotonia</td>
                    <td>- Tall, thin, and fragile body.<br>- Shy, introverted, artistic, thoughtful, private.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>Trait Theories</h3>
        <p>These theories reject the idea of "types." They argue that personality is made up of a <strong>set of continuous dimensions called "traits"</strong> (e.g., "honesty," "friendliness"). People don't fit into one box; rather, they fall on a spectrum for each trait.</p>
        <p><em>(Note: The syllabus does not list specific trait theorists, but the most famous are Gordon Allport and Raymond Cattell).</em></p>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> The key difference is:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type Theory:</strong> Puts people into <em>separate boxes</em> (e.g., You are *either* an introvert *or* an extrovert).</li>
                <li><strong>Trait Theory:</strong> Puts people on a <em>continuous scale</em> (e.g., You can be 20% extroverted or 80% extroverted).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 id="topic3">3. Measurement of Personality</h2>
        <p>Psychologists use various techniques to assess personality. <em>(Note: The syllabus lists "Methods of Personality Measurement" again, suggesting its importance.)</em></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Subjective Methods:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Questionnaires/Inventories:</strong> The most common method. The person answers a series of "Yes/No" or "Agree/Disagree" questions about themselves. (e.g., Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory - MMPI).</li>
                    <li><strong>Autobiography/Interviews:</strong> Asking the person to describe their own life, feelings, and beliefs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Objective Methods:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Watching the person's behavior in a natural or controlled setting (as discussed in Unit 1).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Projective Techniques:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Core Idea:</strong> The person is given an <strong>ambiguous stimulus</strong> (like an inkblot) and asked to describe what they see. The idea is that they will "project" their unconscious thoughts and feelings onto the stimulus.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Rorschach Inkblot Test:</strong> The person describes what they see in a series of 10 complex inkblots.</li>
                            <li><strong>Thematic Apperception Test (TAT):</strong> The person is shown ambiguous pictures of people and asked to tell a story about what is happening.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="topic4">4. Adjustment</h2>

        <h3>Meaning and Factors of Adjustment</h3>
        <p>Adjustment is the psychological process of <strong>coping with and adapting to</strong> the demands, stresses, and challenges of the environment.</p>
        <p>It is a state of balance (equilibrium) between one's needs and the demands of the world. Good adjustment = good mental health.</p>

        <h4>Factors Affecting Adjustment:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Factors:</strong> Physical health, intelligence, emotional stability, self-concept.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> Family (parenting style, home atmosphere), school (teachers, peers), and society (social norms, economic conditions).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Defense Mechanism</h3>
        <p>First proposed by <strong>Sigmund Freud</strong>, defense mechanisms are <strong>unconscious psychological strategies</strong> we use to protect ourselves from anxiety, stress, or a threat to our ego.</p>
        <p>They are normal and healthy in moderation, but over-reliance can be a sign of poor adjustment.</p>
        
        <h4>Common Defense Mechanisms:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Repression:</strong> Unconsciously blocking a painful thought or memory from awareness. (The most basic defense).</li>
            <li><strong>Denial:</strong> Refusing to accept a painful reality. (e.g., A smoker denying that smoking is bad for them).</li>
            <li><strong>Rationalization:</strong> Creating logical-sounding (but false) excuses for our failures or bad behavior. (e.g., "I failed the test because the teacher hates me," not because I didn't study).</li>
            <li><strong>Projection:</strong> Attributing your own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to someone else. (e.g., A person who is secretly dishonest thinks "everyone else is a cheat").</li>
            <li><strong>Displacement:</strong> Shifting your negative emotions (e.g., anger) from a dangerous target to a safer one. (e.g., Your boss yells at you, so you go home and yell at your family).</li>
            <li><strong>Sublimation:</strong> (The <strong>healthiest</strong> defense) Channeling unacceptable impulses (like aggression) into socially acceptable activities (e.g., playing sports, creating art).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic5">5. Frustration</h2>
        
        <h3>Meaning and Causes of Frustration</h3>
        <p>Frustration is the <strong>negative emotional state</strong> that occurs when a goal-directed behavior is <strong>blocked or thwarted</strong>.</p>
        <h4>Causes of Frustration (Sources of Conflict):</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Environmental Obstacles:</strong> External barriers (e.g., a traffic jam, lack of money, a difficult exam).</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Inadequacies:</strong> Internal barriers (e.g., not being smart enough, strong enough, or skilled enough to reach a goal).</li>
            <li><strong>Conflict of Motives:</strong> Being pulled in different directions at the same time.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Approach-Approach:</strong> Choosing between two good things (e.g., two good job offers).</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoidance-Avoidance:</strong> Choosing between two bad things ("caught between a rock and a hard place").</li>
                    <li><strong>Approach-Avoidance:</strong> One goal has both good and bad aspects (e.g., you want to get married, but you are afraid of the responsibility).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Educational Implication of Frustration</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Frustration is a major cause of misbehavior and poor adjustment in school.</li>
            <li><strong>Teacher's Role:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Set realistic goals for students to minimize failure.</li>
                    <li>Provide a supportive environment where students are not afraid to make mistakes.</li>
                    <li>Teach problem-solving skills and constructive ways to handle frustration (e.g., asking for help).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic6">6. Positive-attitude theory (Spare-Time theory)</h2>
        <p>This appears to be a specific or localized term. Based on "Spare-Time," it likely refers to the <strong>Worthy Use of Leisure Time</strong>, which is a key component of adjustment and developing a positive attitude.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Core Idea:</strong> A person's attitude and mental health are significantly influenced by how they use their spare time.</li>
            <li><strong>Positive Attitude:</strong> Using spare time for <strong>constructive and creative</strong> activities (e.g., hobbies, sports, volunteering, learning a new skill) leads to personal growth, satisfaction, and a positive outlook.</li>
            <li><strong>Negative Attitude:</strong> Using spare time for <strong>destructive or passive</strong> activities (e.g., substance abuse, excessive passive screen time, delinquency) leads to frustration, boredom, and poor mental health.</li>
            <li><strong>Educational Implication:</strong> Schools should actively promote co-curricular activities and hobbies to teach students how to use their leisure time wisely.</li>
        </ul>
