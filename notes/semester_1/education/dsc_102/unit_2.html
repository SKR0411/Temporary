            <strong>Note:</strong> Infancy is generally defined as the period from <strong>birth to 2 years</strong>. It is a period of extremely rapid growth and development.
        </div>

        <h2 id="topic1">1. Characteristics of Infancy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rapid Physical Growth:</strong> The infant grows faster during the first year of life than at any other time. Weight often triples and height doubles.</li>
            <li><strong>Dependency:</strong> The infant is completely dependent on caregivers (parents) for all basic needs: food, warmth, safety, and comfort.</li>
            <li><strong>Motor Development:</strong> This period sees the development of basic motor skills, from reflexes to grasping, rolling over, sitting, crawling, and finally walking.</li>
            <li><strong>Sensory Development:</strong> The infant learns about the world through their senses (sight, sound, touch, taste, smell).</li>
            <li><strong>Cognitive Development:</strong> According to Piaget, this is the <strong>Sensorimotor Stage</strong>. The infant understands the world by coordinating sensory experiences (seeing, hearing) with motor actions (grasping, sucking). A key achievement is <strong>Object Permanence</strong> (knowing an object exists even when hidden).</li>
            <li><strong>Beginning of Socialization:</strong> The infant forms their first and most crucial social bond, known as <strong>attachment</strong>, usually with the primary caregiver.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic2">2. Emotional, Social and Motor Development</h2>

        <h3>Emotional Development</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nature of Infant Emotions:</strong> At birth, emotions are very general (e.g., excitement, distress).</li>
            <li><strong>Differentiation:</strong> These general emotions quickly differentiate into more specific ones like joy, anger, fear, and affection.</li>
            <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Infant emotions are intense, short-lived, and expressed openly through crying, smiling, and bodily movements.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Emotion: Affection.</strong> The infant's first social-emotional bond is 'attachment'. A secure attachment, built on trust and responsiveness from the caregiver, is vital for future emotional and social health.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Social Development</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The First Social Response:</strong> The <strong>social smile</strong> (smiling in response to a human face, around 2 months) is the first true sign of social behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Attachment:</strong> As mentioned, forming a secure attachment is the central task of social development in infancy.</li>
            <li><strong>Stranger Anxiety:</strong> Around 6-8 months, infants often show fear or wariness of unfamiliar people. This is a normal sign that they can distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar faces.</li>
            <li><strong>Imitation:</strong> Infants begin to imitate the facial expressions and actions of others, which is a key way they learn social behaviors.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Motor Development</h3>
        <p>This follows the principles from Unit 1 (Cephalocaudal and Proximodistal).</p>

        <h2 id="topic3">3. Language Development</h2>
        <p><span id="spap_3">Language development is one of the most remarkable achievements of infancy.</span> It progresses from simple sounds to complex sentences.</p>
        
        <h3>Stages of Language Development (Pre-Linguistic)</h3>
        <p>This is the stage before the child speaks their first meaningful word.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Crying:</strong> (Birth onwards) The infant's first form of communication, used to signal distress, hunger, or pain.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooing:</strong> (Around 2-4 months) Infants begin to make vowel-like sounds (e.g., "ooooh", "aaaaah"), usually to express pleasure.</li>
            <li><strong>Babbling:</strong> (Around 6 months) The infant starts to produce consonant-vowel combinations in long strings (e.g., "ba-ba-ba", "ma-ma-ma"). This is a crucial stage of speech practice.</li>
            <li><strong>Lallation:</strong> This is a form of "self-imitation" where the infant repeats sounds or syllables they have just produced.</li>
            <li><strong>Echolalia:</strong> (Around 9-12 months) This is the "imitation of others." The infant consciously imitates the sounds, words, and intonations they hear from adults, even without understanding the meaning.</li>
        </OL>
        
        <h3>Linguistic (Speech) Stage</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>First Word / Holophrastic Stage:</strong> (Around 10-14 months) The infant speaks their first recognizable word (e.g., "Mama", "Dada", "ball"). Often, one word is used to convey a whole sentence of meaning (e.g., "Ball?" might mean "Where is the ball?" or "I want the ball").</li>
            <li><strong>Telegraphic Speech:</strong> (Around 18-24 months) The child begins to string two words together (e.g., "Want milk", "Go car"). This speech is like a telegram—it leaves out non-essential words but gets the meaning across.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic4">4. Emotional and Speech Development</h2>
        <p>This section links the two areas of development and examines the factors that influence them.</p>

        <h3>Patterns of Emotions and Speech</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Patterns of Emotions:</strong> As noted, emotions go from general (distress) to specific (fear, anger, joy). They are intense, frequent, but temporary.</li>
            <li><strong>Patterns of Speech:</strong> As noted, speech progresses from Crying -> Cooing -> Babbling -> First Words -> Telegraphic Speech.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Link between them:</strong> Language gives the child a new tool to express emotions. A child who can say "I am angry" (speech) is less likely to just throw a tantrum (emotional expression).
        </div>

        <h3>Factors Influencing Emotional and Speech Development</h3>

        <h4>Factors Influencing Emotional Development:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Health and Physical Condition:</strong> A healthy, well-rested child is generally happier. Sickness or fatigue can lead to irritability.</li>
            <li><strong>Parent-Child Relationship (Attachment):</strong> This is the <strong>most important factor</strong>. A secure, loving, and responsive relationship fosters emotional security, trust, and happiness.</li>
            <li><strong>Family Atmosphere:</strong> A home filled with conflict and stress will lead to more negative emotions (like fear, anxiety) in the infant. A peaceful home fosters security.</li>
            <li><strong>Caregiver's Emotions:</strong> Infants are very sensitive and can "catch" emotions from their caregivers (a process called emotional contagion).</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Factors Influencing Speech Development:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Physical Maturation:</strong> The brain (especially Broca's and Wernicke's areas) and the vocal cords must be mature enough.</li>
            <li><strong>Intelligence:</strong> Brighter children often begin speaking earlier and have larger vocabularies.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Environment (Stimulation):</strong> This is crucial. Children who are spoken to, read to, and interacted with regularly develop language much faster.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Parentese:</strong> The high-pitched, slow, "baby talk" that adults use with infants actually helps the baby learn the sounds and structure of language.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Health:</strong> Hearing impairments (like ear infections) can severely delay speech development, as the child cannot hear the language to imitate it.</li>
            <li><strong>Gender:</strong> On average, girls tend to speak slightly earlier and have a faster vocabulary growth rate than boys in the early years.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Be ready to explain the stages of language development (Crying, Cooing, Babbling, etc.) in the correct sequence. Also, emphasize the critical role of the <strong>family environment</strong> and <strong>stimulation</strong> in both emotional and speech development.
