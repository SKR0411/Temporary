        <h2 id="topic1">1. Peace of Mind, Consciousness and Soul</h2>
        <p>This topic explores the deeper, more profound benefits of yoga beyond just physical health.</p>
        
        <h3>Peace of Mind</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>As defined by Patanjali, yoga is the process of calming the "mind chatter" (<em>chitta vritti nirodhah</em>).</li>
            <li>Practices like <strong>Pranayama</strong> (breathwork) and <strong>Dhyana</strong> (meditation) are specifically designed to slow down the relentless stream of thoughts.</li>
            <li>This process reduces stress, anxiety, and mental agitation, leading to a state of inner stillness, clarity, and <strong>peace of mind</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Consciousness</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Yoga is a science for expanding consciousness.</li>
            <li>Normally, our consciousness is "extroverted"—focused outward on the world through our senses.</li>
            <li>Practices like <strong>Pratyahara</strong> (sense withdrawal) and <strong>Dharana</strong> (concentration) help to turn this consciousness inward.</li>
            <li>This "introversion" of the mind allows us to become aware of the deeper layers of our own being, moving from a state of simple awareness to a higher, more expanded consciousness.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Soul (Atman)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span id="spap_5">The ultimate goal of yoga is <strong>Self-Realization</strong> or <strong>Samadhi</strong>.</span></li>
            <li>This is the realization of one's true, essential nature, which in yogic philosophy is the <strong>Soul (Atman)</strong>.</li>
            <li>The "Soul" is seen as the divine, unchanging, and eternal part of us, distinct from our body, thoughts, or ego.</li>
            <li>Yoga is the path that helps to remove the "layers" of illusion (ego, mind, body-consciousness) that cover the Soul, allowing its true nature to be experienced.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic2">2. Self Control (how to control 5 main demons within us) (Healthy Life)</h2>
        
        <h3>Self-Control and Yoga</h3>
        <p>A "Healthy Life" is not just about a healthy body; it's about a balanced and controlled mind. Self-control is a central theme in yoga, developed through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Yamas and Niyamas:</strong> These are the ethical foundation for self-control in our actions and thoughts.</li>
            <li><strong>Tapas (Discipline):</strong> The Niyama of "discipline" is the direct practice of self-control.</li>
            <li><strong>Pratyahara (Sense Withdrawal):</strong> This is the explicit practice of gaining mastery over the senses, so we are not "slaves" to our cravings.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The "5 Main Demons" (The 5 Kleshas/Vices)</h3>
        <p>Yogic philosophy identifies five main "demons" or "poisons" that are the source of all human suffering and poor health. Controlling these is the key to a healthy life. They are:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Kama (Lust / Excessive Desire):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The endless craving for sensory pleasure or possessions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Yogic Control:</strong> Practicing <strong>Santosha</strong> (Contentment) and <strong>Aparigraha</strong> (Non-hoarding).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Krodha (Anger):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The emotion of rage, hatred, and frustration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Yogic Control:</strong> Practicing <strong>Ahimsa</strong> (Non-violence) and calming <strong>Pranayamas</strong> (like Sitali or Bhramari) to cool the mind.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Lobha (Greed):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The desire to have more and more, an inability to share.</li>
                    <li><strong>Yogic Control:</strong> Practicing <strong>Asteya</strong> (Non-stealing) and <strong>Aparigraha</strong> (Non-possessiveness).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Moha (Attachment / Delusion):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>An unhealthy attachment to people, things, or ideas, which causes pain when they change or are lost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Yogic Control:</strong> Practicing <strong>Svadhyaya</strong> (Self-study) to understand the temporary nature of all things and <strong>Ishvara Pranidhana</strong> (Surrender).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ahamkara (Ego / Pride):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The false sense of "I, me, mine." It is the root of the other four demons.</li>
                    <li><strong>Yogic Control:</strong> Practicing <strong>Bhakti Yoga</strong> (devotion) and <strong>Karma Yoga</strong> (selfless service) to dissolve the ego.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="topic3">3. Significance of International yoga day</h2>

        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Date:</strong> International Day of Yoga (IDY) is celebrated every year on <strong>June 21st</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Origin:</strong> It was proposed by the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, during his speech at the UN General Assembly in 2014. The proposal was adopted by a record 177 member states.</li>

        </ul>
