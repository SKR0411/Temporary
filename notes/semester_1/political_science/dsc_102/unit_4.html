        <h3>Relations between the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha</h3>
        <p>The Lok Sabha is more powerful than the Rajya Sabha, particularly in financial matters.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unequal Status:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A **Money Bill** can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha can only delay it for 14 days.</li>
                    <li>The Council of Ministers is responsible only to the Lok Sabha. A no-confidence motion can only be moved in the Lok Sabha.</li>
                    <li>In case of a deadlock on an ordinary bill, the will of the Lok Sabha usually prevails in a **joint sitting** due to its larger membership.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Special Powers of Rajya Sabha:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>It can authorize the Parliament to make a law on a subject in the State List (Article 249).</li>
                    <li>It can authorize the Parliament to create new All-India Services (Article 312).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="judiciary">The Judiciary: The Supreme Court</h2>
        <p>India has an integrated and independent judiciary with the Supreme Court at its apex (Articles 124-147).</p>
        
        <h3>Composition and Jurisdiction</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Composition:</strong> The Supreme Court consists of a Chief Justice of India (CJI) and not more than 33 other judges (total 34). Judges are appointed by the President and hold office until they attain the age of 65 years.</li>
            <li><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> The Supreme Court has wide-ranging jurisdiction:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Original Jurisdiction:</strong> Deals with disputes between the Centre and states, or between states.</li>
                    <li><strong>Writ Jurisdiction (Art. 32):</strong> Can issue writs (Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, etc.) for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights.</li>
                    <li><strong>Appellate Jurisdiction:</strong> The highest court of appeal in all civil and criminal cases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advisory Jurisdiction (Art. 143):</strong> Can give its opinion on any question of law or fact referred to it by the President.</li>
                    <li><strong>Court of Record:</strong> Its judgments are recorded for perpetual memory and testimony.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Judicial Review</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> Judicial Review is the power of the judiciary to examine the constitutionality of legislative enactments and executive orders of both the Central and State governments.
        </blockquote>
        <p>If a law or action is found to be in violation of the Constitution, it can be declared null and void by the judiciary. This power makes the Supreme Court the ultimate interpreter and guardian of the Constitution and the guarantor of Fundamental Rights. The Supreme Court declared Judicial Review to be a part of the **'basic structure'** of the Constitution in the Kesavananda Bharati case (1973).</p>

        <h3>Judicial Activism</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> Judicial Activism refers to a proactive role played by the judiciary in the protection of the rights of citizens and in the promotion of justice in society.
        </blockquote>
        <p>It implies the judiciary going beyond its traditional role of a mere interpreter of the law and taking on a more assertive role in directing the executive and legislature to act. Key instruments of judicial activism in India have been:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Public Interest Litigation (PIL):</strong> Allows any person to approach the court on behalf of the public or any disadvantaged group.</li>
            <li><strong>Liberal interpretation of Fundamental Rights:</strong> For example, the expansion of Article 21 (Right to Life) to include the right to a clean environment, right to privacy, right to speedy trial, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>⚠️ Common Pitfall:</strong> Do not confuse Judicial Review and Judicial Activism.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Judicial Review</strong> is the *power* of the court to check the constitutionality of laws. It is a fundamental feature.</li>
                <li><strong>Judicial Activism</strong> is the *philosophy* or *approach* of using that power proactively to bring about social change. It is a mode of judicial behavior.</li>
            </ul>
