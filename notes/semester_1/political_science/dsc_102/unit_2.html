        <h2 id="nature">Federalism: Nature of Federalism</h2>
        <p>Federalism is a system of government in which power is divided between a central authority and various constituent units of the country. India is often described as a **'quasi-federal'** state or a **"federal system with a strong unitary bias"**.</p>
        
        <h3>Federal Features of the Indian Constitution</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dual Polity:</strong> Government at two levels - the Union and the States.</li>
            <li><strong>Written Constitution:</strong> The powers and functions of both governments are specified in the Constitution.</li>
            <li><strong>Division of Powers:</strong> The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution divides subjects into three lists:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Union List:</strong> Subjects of national importance (defence, foreign affairs, currency). Only the Union Parliament can legislate.</li>
                    <li><strong>State List:</strong> Subjects of local/regional importance (police, public health, agriculture). Only State Legislatures can legislate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Concurrent List:</strong> Subjects of common interest (education, forests, marriage). Both can legislate, but in case of a conflict, the Union law prevails.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Supremacy of the Constitution:</strong> The Constitution is the supreme law of the land.</li>
            <li><strong>Rigid Constitution:</strong> The federal provisions of the Constitution cannot be amended easily.</li>
            <li><strong>Independent Judiciary:</strong> The Supreme Court acts as the umpire in case of disputes between the Centre and the States.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Unitary (Non-Federal) Features of the Indian Constitution</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strong Centre:</strong> The Union List contains more subjects, and the Centre has overriding authority in the Concurrent List.</li>
            <li><strong>Single Constitution:</strong> Both the Centre and the States operate under a single constitutional framework.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility of the Constitution:</strong> The bulk of the Constitution can be amended by the Parliament alone.</li>
            <li><strong>Single Citizenship:</strong> All citizens of India have a single, uniform citizenship.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrated Judiciary:</strong> A single hierarchy of courts with the Supreme Court at the top.</li>
            <li><strong>Appointment of Governor:</strong> The Governor of a state is appointed by the President and acts as an agent of the Centre.</li>
            <li><strong>Emergency Provisions:</strong> The Centre can assume control over the states during a national emergency (Art. 352), state emergency (Art. 356), or financial emergency (Art. 360).</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Remember This!</strong> The term 'Federation' is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution. Instead, **Article 1** describes India as a **'Union of States'**. This implies that the Indian federation is not the result of an agreement among the states, and the states have no right to secede from the union.
        </div>

        <h2 id="relations">Union-State Relations</h2>
        <p>The relations between the Union and the States can be studied under three heads:</p>
        
        <h3>Legislative Relations (Articles 245-255)</h3>
        <p>This pertains to the distribution of law-making powers.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Territorial Jurisdiction:</strong> Parliament can make laws for the whole or any part of India. A state legislature can make laws for the whole or any part of the state.</li>
            <li><strong>Distribution of Subjects:</strong> As discussed, the division is based on the Union, State, and Concurrent lists.</li>
            <li><strong>Parliamentary Legislation in State Field:</strong> Under certain extraordinary circumstances, the Parliament can make laws on subjects in the State List, for example:
                <ul>
                    <li>When Rajya Sabha passes a resolution (Art. 249).</li>
                    <li>During a National Emergency (Art. 352).</li>
                    <li>To implement international agreements (Art. 253).</li>
                    <li>During President's Rule (Art. 356).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Administrative Relations (Articles 256-263)</h3>
        <p>This deals with the executive powers of the Centre and States.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The executive power of the state must be exercised in compliance with the laws made by the Parliament.</li>
            <li>The Centre can give directions to the states to ensure compliance.</li>
            <li>Provisions for Inter-State Council (Art. 263) to promote cooperation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Financial Relations (Articles 268-293)</h3>
        <p>This covers the distribution of financial resources.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Taxing Powers:** The Constitution allocates taxing powers between the Centre and the States.</li>
            <li>**Distribution of Tax Revenues:** Taxes levied by the Centre are distributed between the Centre and the states based on the recommendations of the **Finance Commission (Article 280)**.</li>
            <li>**Grants-in-Aid:** The Centre provides grants to the states to help them meet their financial needs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="commissions">Sarkaria Commission and Punchhi Commission</h2>
        <p>Over the years, strains have appeared in Centre-State relations. Several commissions have been set up to review the existing arrangements.</p>

        <h3>Sarkaria Commission (1983)</h3>
        <p>Headed by Justice R.S. Sarkaria, this commission was tasked with examining Centre-State relations. It submitted its report in 1988 with 247 recommendations. It strongly favoured cooperative federalism and did not suggest major structural changes.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Recommendations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use of **Article 356 (President's Rule)** should be a last resort, used only in cases of actual breakdown of constitutional machinery.</li>
            <li>The institution of **All-India Services** should be further strengthened.</li>
            <li>The **Governor** should be an eminent person from outside the state and should not be too active in politics.</li>
            <li>The residuary powers of taxation should continue to remain with the Parliament.</li>
            <li>A permanent **Inter-State Council** should be set up.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Punchhi Commission (2007)</h3>
        <p>Headed by former Chief Justice of India, Madan Mohan Punchhi, this commission was set up to look into the new issues of Centre-State relations keeping in view the changes in the polity and economy of India since the Sarkaria Commission.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Recommendations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>On **Article 356**, it recommended an amendment to allow for localized emergency provisions in specific troubled areas of a state, instead of dismissing the entire state government.</li>
            <li>On the **appointment of Governors**, it suggested that the Governor should have a fixed tenure of five years and should be removable only through a resolution by the state legislature.</li>
            <li>Advocated for giving more powers to the states in making laws on the **Concurrent List**.</li>
            <li>Recommended a new treaty for all inter-state river water disputes.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Both commissions are extremely important for questions on Centre-State relations. Focus on their recommendations regarding the office of the Governor and the use of Article 356, as these are the most contentious issues.
