        <span id="span_77"><h2 id="debate1">Debate: Is Democracy Compatible with Economic Growth?</span></h2>
        <p>This debate examines the relationship between a country's political system and its economic performance. There is no simple answer, and strong arguments exist on both sides.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>The Core Question:</strong> Does democracy help or hinder rapid economic development?
        </blockquote>

                <h3>Arguments that Democracy HINDERS Economic Growth</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Slow Decision-Making:</strong> Democratic processes involving debate, consultation, and consensus-building can be slow, delaying important economic reforms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Populist Pressures:</strong> Politicians may prioritize short-term populist policies (like subsidies) to win elections, rather than making tough long-term economic decisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Influence of Interest Groups:</strong> Powerful lobbies and interest groups can block necessary reforms that might harm their specific interests but benefit the economy as a whole.</li>
                    <li><strong>Political Instability:</strong> Frequent changes in government can lead to policy uncertainty, which discourages long-term investment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> The rapid, state-led economic growth of authoritarian countries like China and Singapore is often cited as evidence that strong, centralized rule can be more effective for development.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="argument-box for-box">
                <h3>Arguments that Democracy PROMOTES Economic Growth</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Protection of Property Rights:</strong> Democracies, with their emphasis on the rule of law and independent judiciaries, provide a more secure environment for property rights, which is essential for investment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stability and Predictability:</strong> While individual governments may change, the democratic system itself provides long-term stability and predictable rules, which are good for business.</li>
                    <li><strong>Better Information Flow:</strong> A free press and open debate allow for better information, helping to correct policy mistakes and expose corruption. As Amartya Sen noted, famines don't happen in functioning democracies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Human Capital Development:</strong> Democracies tend to invest more in education and health, leading to a more productive workforce.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Most of the world's wealthiest and most developed nations are stable democracies (e.g., USA, Germany, Japan, Nordic countries).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> A good answer should conclude that the relationship is complex. There is no iron law that one system is always better. The quality of institutions (like rule of law, bureaucracy) and specific government policies are often more important than the regime type itself. The famous scholar Amartya Sen argues that 'Development as Freedom' is the ultimate goal, where political freedom (democracy) is an integral part of development itself, not just a means to an end.

        <span id="span_78"><h2 id="debate2">Debate: Is Censorship Justified?</span></h2>
        <p>Censorship is the suppression of speech, public communication, or other information which may be considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or inconvenient. This debate pits the value of free expression against other values like security and public order.</p>

        <span id="span_79"><h3>Grounds of Censorship and its Limits</span></h3>
        
        <div class="debate-section">
            <div class="argument-box for-box">
                <h3>Arguments FOR Justified Censorship (Grounds)</h3>
                <p>Proponents argue that freedom of speech is not absolute and can be restricted for the greater good on several grounds:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>National Security:</strong> To prevent the spread of state secrets, incitement to violence, or information that could endanger the nation during wartime.</li>
                    <li><strong>Public Order and Safety:</strong> To restrict hate speech that incites violence against groups, or to prevent panic (e.g., falsely shouting 'fire' in a crowded theater).</li>
                    <li><strong>Protection of Minors:</strong> To shield children from sexually explicit or violent content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Preventing Defamation:</strong> To protect individuals' reputations from slander (spoken) and libel (written) falsehoods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> To prevent copyright infringement and piracy.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="argument-box against-box">
                <h3>Arguments AGAINST Censorship (For Free Expression)</h3>
                <p>Opponents, like John Stuart Mill, argue that censorship is fundamentally harmful:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Slippery Slope:</strong> Once the government is given the power to censor, it's hard to limit. It can easily be abused to silence political dissent and criticism.</li>
                    <li><strong>Marketplace of Ideas:</strong> The best way to combat bad ideas is with better ideas, not suppression. Truth will ultimately prevail in a free and open debate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Who Decides?:</strong> Censors are fallible. An idea censored today might turn out to be true or valuable tomorrow (e.g., Galileo's theories).</li>
                    <li><strong>Infantilization of Citizens:</strong> Censorship treats adults like children who cannot be trusted to think for themselves and make their own judgments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chilling Effect:</strong> Even the threat of censorship can discourage people from expressing controversial or unpopular views, leading to self-censorship and a less vibrant public discourse.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <span id="span_80"><h3>The Limits of Censorship</span></h3>
        <p>Even when censorship is deemed necessary, it must be strictly limited. The key principles for limitation are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Legality:</strong> The restriction must be clearly defined in law.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimacy:</strong> It must serve a legitimate aim (like protecting national security, not just shielding the government from criticism).</li>
            <li><strong>Necessity and Proportionality:</strong> The censorship must be necessary to achieve the aim, and the harm it prevents must be greater than the harm caused by restricting speech. It should be the least restrictive means possible.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Remember This!</strong> This debate often revolves around Mill's <strong>Harm Principle</strong>: "The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others." The challenge lies in defining 'harm'. Does it include offense? Psychological harm? Or only physical harm?
