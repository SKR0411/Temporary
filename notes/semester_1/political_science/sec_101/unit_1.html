        <h2 id="intro">1. <span id="span_3">Introduction to People's Representatives</span></h2>
        <p>In a representative democracy like India, citizens elect individuals to represent their interests in the government's law-making bodies. <span id="span_4">These elected officials are known as "People's Representatives."</span> Their primary job is to act as a bridge between the people and the government, ensuring that the voices of their constituents are heard and that the government is held accountable.</p>
        <span id="span_5"><p>This unit focuses on representatives at the Union (Parliament) and State levels.</span></p>

        <h2 id="mp">2. <span id="span_6">Members of the Parliament (MPs)</span></h2>
        <p>A Member of Parliament (MP) is a representative elected to one of the two houses of the Indian Parliament: the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha.</p>
        
        <h3>Roles and Functions of an MP</h3>
        <ul>
            <span id="span_7"><li><strong>Legislative Role:</strong> The most important function is to legislate, i.e., to make, amend, or repeal laws on subjects listed in the Union List and Concurrent List.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Representative Role:</strong> An MP acts as the voice of their constituency (in Lok Sabha) or their state (in Rajya Sabha), raising local issues and concerns at the national level.</li>
            <li><strong>Oversight Role:</strong> They hold the executive (the government) accountable. <span id="span_8">This is a critical function of legislative support.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Financial Role:</strong> MPs have the power of the purse. <span id="span_9"><span id="span_10">They scrutinize and pass the Union Budget, and no tax can be levied or money spent without their approval.</span></span></li>
            <span id="span_11"><li><strong>Constituent Role:</strong> MPs have the power to amend the Constitution, following the procedure in Article 368.</span></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Powers of an MP</h3>
        <p>To fulfill their roles, MPs are vested with significant powers:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Power</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Power to Question</strong></td>
                    <td>During 'Question Hour', MPs can ask questions to ministers to seek information and hold them accountable for their ministry's functioning.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Power to Introduce Bills</strong></td>
                    <td>An MP (who is not a minister) can introduce a 'Private Member's Bill'. Ministers introduce 'Government Bills'.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Power to Debate & Vote</strong></td>
                    <td>MPs participate in debates on bills, motions, and national issues. <span id="span_12">They vote on all legislation, including the budget and constitutional amendments.</span></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Power of Motions</strong></td>
                    <td>They can move various motions like 'Adjournment Motion' (to discuss an urgent public matter), 'No-Confidence Motion' (to test the government's majority), or 'Cut Motions' (during the budget).</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Committee Membership</strong></td>
                    <td>A significant amount of legislative work happens in Parliamentary Committees. <span id="span_13"><span id="span_14">MPs get to be members of these committees for detailed scrutiny of bills and government spending.</span></span></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2 id="sla">3. <span id="span_15">Members of State Legislatures (MLAs/MLCs)</span></h2>
        <p>A Member of a State Legislature is the state-level equivalent of an MP. Most states have a unicameral (one house) legislature, the <strong>Vidhan Sabha (Legislative Assembly)</strong>, and its members are <strong>MLAs</strong>. Some states have a bicameral (two-house) system, which also includes a <strong>Vidhan Parishad (Legislative Council)</strong>, and its members are <strong>MLCs</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Roles and Functions of MLAs/MLCs</h3>
        <span id="span_16"><p>Their roles are very similar to MPs but operate within the jurisdiction of the state.</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legislative Role:</strong> To make laws on subjects in the <strong>State List</strong> and <strong>Concurrent List</strong>. (In case of a conflict on a Concurrent List item, the Union law prevails).</li>
            <li><strong>Representative Role:</strong> An MLA represents their specific constituency within the state, raising local issues like water, electricity, roads, and law and order in the State Assembly.</li>
            <li><strong>Oversight Role:</strong> They hold the state government (Chief Minister and State Council of Ministers) accountable through questions, debates, and motions.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Role:</strong> They scrutinize and pass the State Budget.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Key Distinction:</strong> The biggest difference between an MP and an MLA is their s-p-here of legislation.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MP (Parliament):</strong> Legislates on national issues (Union List) like Defence, Foreign Affairs, Currency.</li>
                <li><strong>MLA (State Legislature):</strong> Legislates on state/local issues (State List) like Police, Public Health, Agriculture.</li>
            </ul>
