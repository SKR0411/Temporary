        <span id="span_6"><h3>Definition of State</h3></span>
        <p>The state is the central and most powerful institution in political science. It is a political organization that possesses ultimate authority (sovereignty) over a defined territory and its population.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Garner's Definition:</strong> "The state is a community of persons, more or less numerous, permanently occupying a definite portion of territory, independent (or nearly so) of external control, and possessing an organized government to which the great body of inhabitants render habitual obedience."
        </blockquote>

        <span id="span_7"><h3>Elements of the State</h3></span>
        <p>The state is composed of four essential elements. The absence of any one of them means there is no state.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Population:</strong> The human element. There must be a population, though its size is not fixed (e.g., China vs. Vatican City).</li>
            <li><strong>Territory:</strong> A definite geographical area over which the state has control. This includes land, water, and airspace.</li>
            <li><strong>Government:</strong> The machinery or agency through which the will of the state is formulated, expressed, and realized. It makes and enforces laws.</li>
            <li><strong>Sovereignty:</strong> The supreme and absolute power of the state. It has two aspects:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Internal Sovereignty:</strong> The state is the highest authority within its territory.</li>
                    <li><strong>External Sovereignty:</strong> The state is independent and free from foreign control.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>⚠️ Common Pitfall:</strong> Do not confuse 'State' and 'Government'.
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>State</strong> is the permanent and abstract entity (the "ship"). It includes all citizens, its territory, and sovereignty.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Government</strong> is the temporary and concrete machinery that runs the state (the "crew"). Governments change, but the state remains.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <span id="span_8"><h2 id="origin">Theories of Origin of State</h2></span>
        <p>These theories are speculative attempts to explain how the state first came into being.</p>

        <span id="span_9"><h3>The Divine Origin Theory</h3></span>
        <p>This is the oldest theory. It holds that the state was created by God, and the ruler (King) is God's representative on Earth.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Core Idea:</strong> The King is accountable only to God, not to the people. To rebel against the King is to rebel against God.</li>
            <li><strong>Significance:</strong> It was a powerful tool to justify absolute monarchy and demand unquestioning obedience from subjects.</li>
            <li><strong>Criticism:</strong> It is based on faith, not historical fact or reason. It is undemocratic and promotes the status quo.</li>
        </ul>

        <span id="span_10"><h3>The Social Contract Theory</h3></span>
        <p>This theory argues that the state is not a natural or divine creation, but a deliberate human creation—an "artificial" institution made by a contract.</p>
        <p>It posits a hypothetical "state of nature" (life before the state) from which people escaped by forming a contract.</p>

                    <td>Peaceful, but inconvenient. People had natural rights (Life, Liberty, Property) but no common judge.</td>

                    <td>The rise of private property corrupted people and created inequality.</td>

                    <td>People surrender only the right to interpret and enforce the law of nature. A limited government.</td>
                    <td>People surrender their individual wills to a "General Will" (the common good).</td>

                    <td><strong>Result (Sovereignty)</strong></td>
                    <td>Absolute, indivisible sovereignty.</td>
                    <td>Limited, constitutional sovereignty. People have the right to revolt.</td>
                    <td>Popular sovereignty. The people are the sovereign.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><strong>Criticism:</strong> It is unhistorical (there is no evidence of such a contract). The 'state of nature' is a fiction. However, its great value lies in promoting the ideas that the state is a human creation, based on the consent of the governed.</p>

        <span id="span_11"><h3>The Evolutionary Theory (or Historical/Sociological Theory)</h3></span>
        <p>This is the most scientifically accepted theory. It argues that the state is not a product of a single event or contract, but the result of a slow, gradual process of evolution over a long period.</p>
        <p>The state is a "growth, not a make". Several factors contributed to its development:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Kinship:</strong> The earliest form of social organization was based on family and blood ties, which fostered authority and unity.</li>
            <li><strong>Religion:</strong> Common worship and shared beliefs reinforced the authority of leaders (who were often both priest and king) and created social cohesion.</li>
            <li><strong>War and Force:</strong> Conflict and conquest led to the subjugation of one group by another, the need for defense, and the rise of a military leader, a forerunner of the king.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Activities:</strong> The shift from hunting to agriculture led to private property and the need for a stable institution to regulate property rights and manage irrigation.</li>
            <li><strong>Political Consciousness:</strong> The gradual realization of the need for a common authority to protect, regulate, and promote common welfare.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> While the Social Contract theory is historically inaccurate, it is philosophically very important. The Evolutionary Theory is the most accurate explanation of *how* the state came into being.
