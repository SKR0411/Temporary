        <span id="span_16"><h2 id="meaning">Sovereignty: Meaning, Definition and Kinds</h2></span>

        <span id="span_17"><h3>Meaning and Definition</h3></span>
        <p>Sovereignty is the most essential element of the state. It means the supreme and absolute power of the state, subject to no other authority.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Jean Bodin:</strong> "Sovereignty is the supreme power of the state over citizens and subjects, unrestrained by law."
        </blockquote>

        <p>Sovereignty has two aspects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Internal Sovereignty:</strong> The state is the highest authority within its territory. All individuals and associations within the state are subject to its commands.</li>
            <li><strong>External Sovereignty:</strong> The state is independent and free from external control. It can determine its own foreign policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <span id="span_18"><h3>Kinds of Sovereignty</h3></span>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Titular vs. Real Sovereignty:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Titular:</strong> The sovereign who holds power in name only (e.g., the King or Queen of the UK).</li>
                    <li><strong>Real:</strong> The sovereign who actually exercises power (e.g., the Parliament in the UK).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Legal vs. Political Sovereignty:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Legal:</strong> The supreme law-making authority (e.g., the Parliament in India). Its power is absolute and legally unlimited.</li>
                    <li><strong>Political:</strong> The power *behind* the legal sovereign – the will of the people or the electorate. The legal sovereign must ultimately bow to the political sovereign.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>De Jure vs. De Facto Sovereignty:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>De Jure:</strong> The sovereign who has the legal right to rule.</li>
                    <li><strong>De Facto:</strong> The sovereign who has the actual power to rule, often having gained it through a revolution or coup (e.im, a military dictator).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Popular Sovereignty:</strong> The idea that the ultimate supreme power resides with the people. This is the basis of democracy.</li>
        </ul>

        <span id="span_19"><h2 id="austin">Austin's Theory of Sovereignty (Monistic Theory)</h2></span>
        <p>John Austin, in his book "Lectures on Jurisprudence," gave the classic "Monistic Theory" of sovereignty. This theory views sovereignty as a single, indivisible, and absolute entity.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Principles:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Sovereign is a "Determinate Human Superior":</strong> In every state, there is a specific person or body of persons (like the Parliament) who is the sovereign.</li>
            <li><strong>Sovereign Receives Habitual Obedience:</strong> The majority of society has a habit of obeying this superior.</li>
            <li><strong>Sovereign is Not Obedient to Others:</strong> The sovereign superior does not obey any other authority.</li>
            <li><strong>Law is the "Command of the Sovereign":</strong> Law is whatever the sovereign says it is.</li>
            <li><strong>Sovereignty is Absolute and Indivisible:</strong> The sovereign's power is unlimited and cannot be divided.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Criticism:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hard to find a "determinate superior"</strong> in many states (e.g., in a federal system like the USA, power is divided).</li>
            <li><strong>Ignores Political Sovereignty:</strong> It focuses only on legal power and ignores the power of the people.</li>
            <li><strong>Law is not just Command:</strong> It ignores other sources of law, like customs and traditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Ignores International Law:</strong> The idea of absolute external sovereignty is challenged by international law and organizations.</li>
        </ul>

        <span id="span_20"><h2 id="pluralist">Pluralistic Theory of Sovereignty</h2></span>
        <p>The Pluralistic theory is a direct challenge to Austin's Monistic theory. Pluralists argue that sovereignty is not the sole possession of the state.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Principles:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Society is Federative:</strong> Society is not a uniform mass but a collection of many different associations (families, churches, trade unions, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Associations are as Important as the State:</strong> These associations are as "natural" and important as the state. Individuals have loyalties to many groups, not just the state.</li>
            <li><strong>The State is just one Association:</strong> The state is just one association among many. It has a special role in coordinating, but it is not supreme over all others.</li>
            <li><strong>Sovereignty is Divided:</strong> Power in society is and should be divided among the state and these various associations.</li>
            <li><strong>The State's Power is Not Absolute:</strong> The state's power should be limited. Its laws should be obeyed only if they align with moral principles and public good.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Harold Laski (Pluralist):</strong> "Since society is federal, authority must be federal."
        </blockquote>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> This is a classic "compare and contrast" question.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monism (Austin):</strong> Sovereignty is <strong>One</strong> (Monist). It is <strong>Absolute</strong>. It is <strong>located</strong> in the State.</li>
                <li><strong>Pluralism (Laski):</strong> Sovereignty is <strong>Many</strong> (Pluralist). It is <strong>Limited</strong>. It is <strong>divided</strong> among the State and other associations.</li>
            </ul>
