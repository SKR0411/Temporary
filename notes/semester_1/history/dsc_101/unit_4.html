        <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction to Vedic Culture</h2>
        <p>The Vedic Culture (approx. 1500 BCE – 600 BCE) is the period when the <strong>Vedas</strong>, the foundational sacred texts of Hinduism, were composed. This culture is associated with the Indo-Aryans, a pastoralist people who settled in the northern Indian subcontinent.</p>
        <p>This period is divided into two distinct phases, which show significant changes in society, politics, and religion.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rig Vedic Period (1500–1000 BCE):</strong> The time when the Rig Veda was composed. Centered on the <em>Sapta-Sindhu</em> (land of seven rivers) region in the Punjab.</li>
            <li><strong>Later Vedic Period (1000–600 BCE):</strong> The time when the other Vedas (Sama, Yajur, Atharva) and their accompanying texts were composed. The culture's center shifted eastward to the <strong>Ganga-Yamuna doab</strong>. This period saw the first use of <strong>iron</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="rig-vedic">2. Rig Vedic Period (Early Vedic Period)</h2>
        <p><em>(Approx. 1500 BCE – 1000 BCE)</em></p>
        <p>Our knowledge of this period comes almost exclusively from the <strong>Rig Veda</strong>, the oldest of the Vedas.</p>

        <h3>i) Rig Vedic Polity</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tribal System:</strong> The main political unit was the tribe, called <strong>Jana</strong> (e.g., Bharatas, Purus).</li>
            <li><strong>The King (Rajan):</strong> The king was a tribal chieftain, not an absolute ruler. His position was often <strong>not hereditary</strong>. His main duty was to protect the tribe and its cattle (*Gopati* - Lord of Cattle).</li>
            <li><strong>Tribal Assemblies:</strong> The king's power was checked by two important assemblies:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sabha:</strong> A council of elder and important members of the tribe.</li>
                    <li><strong>Samiti:</strong> A general assembly of the entire tribe. <strong>Women were allowed to attend</strong> both.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>ii) Rig Vedic Economy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pastoralist:</strong> The economy was <strong>primarily pastoral</strong> and semi-nomadic. <strong>Cattle were the main source of wealth</strong> (<em>Gomat</em> = wealthy man). Wars (*Gavishti*) were often fought for cattle.</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Agriculture:</strong> Agriculture was known but was a secondary occupation. They primarily grew barley (<em>Yava</em>).</li>
            <li><strong>No Private Land:</strong> There was no concept of private land ownership. Land was held in common by the tribe.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>iii) Rig Vedic Society</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Kinship-Based:</strong> The society was organized based on kinship. The family (*Kula*) was the basic unit, headed by the *Kulapati*.</li>
            <li><strong>Status of Women:</strong> Women were highly respected. They could attend assemblies, participate in rituals, and even compose hymns (e.g., Lopamudra, Ghosha, Apala). There was no child marriage, and widow remarriage was permitted.</li>
            <li><strong>Varna System:</strong> The Varna (color/class) system was <strong>flexible and based on occupation (Karma), not birth (Janma)</strong>. The Rig Veda (in a late hymn) mentions the four Varnas (Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra) but it was not a rigid hierarchy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>iv) Rig Vedic Religion</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nature Worship:</strong> They worshipped natural forces, personifying them as gods.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Gods:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Indra:</strong> Most important god. God of war, storm, and rain (also called *Purandara* - breaker of forts).</li>
                    <li><strong>Agni:</strong> Second most important. God of fire, seen as the intermediary between gods and humans.</li>
                    <li><strong>Varuna:</strong> Upholder of the cosmic order (<em>Rita</em>).</li>
                    <li><strong>Surya (Sun), Usha (Dawn).</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Rituals:</strong> Worship was simple. They performed sacrifices (<strong>Yajnas</strong>) to gain <em>Praja</em> (children) and <em>Pashu</em> (cattle). There were <strong>no temples and no idol worship</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="later-vedic">3. Later Vedic Period</h2>
        <p><em>(Approx. 1000 BCE – 600 BCE)</em></p>
        <p>This period saw profound changes, driven by the expansion into the fertile Gangetic plains and the use of <strong>iron technology</strong>.</p>

        <h3>i) Later Vedic Polity</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rise of Kingdoms:</strong> The tribal *Janas* consolidated into territorial kingdoms called <strong>Janapadas</strong> (e.g., Kuru, Panchala).</li>
            <li><strong>King's Power Increases:</strong> The king's power grew immensely. The position became <strong>hereditary</strong>. He was no longer just a tribal chief but the ruler of a territory.</li>
            <li><strong>Elaborate Rituals:</strong> The king performed complex royal sacrifices to legitimize his power, such as the <strong>Rajasuya</strong> (consecration), <strong>Ashvamedha</strong> (horse sacrifice), and <em>Vajapeya</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Decline of Assemblies:</strong> The Sabha and Samiti lost their importance, and women were no longer allowed to attend.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>ii) Later Vedic Economy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Agriculture becomes Primary:</strong> With the use of <strong>iron ploughs</strong>, people cleared the dense forests of the Ganga valley. <strong>Agriculture became the main occupation</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Crops:</strong> They cultivated rice (<em>Vrihi</em>), wheat, barley, and cotton.</li>
            <li><strong>Private Land:</strong> The concept of private ownership of land began to emerge.</li>
            <li><strong>Crafts:</strong> New crafts like iron-smithing, pottery (Painted Grey Ware - PGW), and weaving emerged. Guilds (*Shreni*) also began to form.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>iii) Later Vedic Society</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rigid Varna System:</strong> The Varna system became <strong>rigid, hierarchical, and based on birth (Janma)</strong>. The four Varnas had clearly defined roles, with Brahmins (priests) and Kshatriyas (warriors) at the top.</li>
            <li><strong>Decline in Status of Women:</strong> The status of women declined significantly. They were barred from assemblies, lost their right to the Upanayana (initiation) ceremony, and child marriage began to appear.</li>
            <li><strong>Concept of Gotra:</strong> The system of *Gotra* (lineage) emerged, and marriage within the same Gotra was forbidden.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>iv) Later Vedic Religion</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Complex Rituals:</strong> Religion became dominated by complex, expensive, and lengthy <strong>rituals and sacrifices</strong>, which could only be performed by the Brahmin priests. The simple worship of the Rig Vedic age was lost.</li>
            <li><strong>New Gods:</strong> The old gods (Indra, Agni) lost their importance. New gods rose to prominence:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Prajapati:</strong> The Creator (became the supreme god).</li>
                    <li><strong>Vishnu:</strong> The Preserver.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rudra:</strong> An early form of Shiva.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Reaction (Upanishads):</strong> Towards the end of this period, a philosophical reaction against these empty rituals began. This is seen in the <strong>Upanishads</strong>, which emphasized knowledge (<em>Jnana</em>), the self (<em>Atman</em>), and the ultimate reality (<em>Brahman</em>). This philosophical ferment paved the way for Buddhism and Jainism.</li>
        </ul>
