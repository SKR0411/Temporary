        <p class="note">This unit focuses on the crucial contributions of Indian archaeologists, particularly those who worked under John Marshall and those who were trained by Mortimer Wheeler, bridging the colonial and post-colonial eras of the ASI.</p>

            <h2>1. Contributions of R.D. Banerjee (Rakhaldas Banerjee)</h2>
            <p>R.D. Banerjee was an Indian archaeologist and officer of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) working under Sir John Marshall.</p>
            
            <h3>Major Contribution: Discovery of Mohenjo-Daro</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In <strong>1921-22</strong>, Banerjee was excavating a Buddhist Stupa (from the Kushan period) at a site in the Sindh province (now in Pakistan).</li>
                <li>Below the stupa, he found flint tools and distinctive seals that were clearly much older.</li>
                <li>He recognized their antiquity and correctly identified them as belonging to a pre-Mauryan "chalcolithic" (copper-age) culture.</li>
                <li>His discovery of the "Mound of the Dead" (Mohenjo-Daro) was the crucial second piece of the puzzle (along with Sahani's finds at Harappa) that led Marshall to announce the discovery of the Indus Valley Civilization in 1924.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Other Contributions</h3>
            <p>Banerjee was also a historian and epigraphist, known for his work on the Pala dynasty of Bengal and for identifying the Gangaridai (a people mentioned by Greek historians) with Bengal.</p>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Exam Mnemonic:</strong> <strong>R.D. Banerjee</strong> → <strong>M.D.</strong> (Mohenjo-Daro). Remember, he found the *second* major IVC site, which confirmed its status as a full-fledged civilization.

        <section id="topic2">
            <h2>2. Contributions of Dayaram Sahani</h2>
            <p>Rai Bahadur Dayaram Sahani was another key Indian officer in the ASI under John Marshall.</p>
            
            <h3>Major Contribution: First Excavations at Harappa</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Harappa had been known since the 19th century (seals from there were even published by Cunningham), but its true significance was not understood.</li>
                <li>In <strong>1920-21</strong>, Sir John Marshall assigned Dayaram Sahani to conduct the first systematic excavations at the site.</li>
                <li>Sahani's excavations unearthed seals, pottery, and structural remains that were clearly part of a major, unknown ancient city.</li>
                <li>His findings were the *first* evidence of what would soon be called the Indus Valley Civilization.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Exam Mnemonic:</strong> <strong>D. Sahani</strong> → <strong>H.</strong> (Harappa). (This is a stretch, but helps differentiate!) Remember, Sahani was at Harappa *first*, and Banerjee was at Mohenjo-Daro *second*. Both were needed for the final discovery.

            <h2>3. Contributions of Nani Gopal Majumdar</h2>
            <p>N.G. Majumdar was a brilliant and dedicated ASI archaeologist who significantly expanded the map of the Indus Valley Civilization.</p>

            <h3>Major Contribution: Exploration in Sindh</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>While Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro were the "capital cities," Majumdar was an explorer.</li>
                <li>He conducted extensive, systematic surveys in the <strong>Sindh province</strong>, walking from site to site.</li>
                <li>He discovered and test-excavated numerous other IVC sites, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Chanhudaro:</strong> A major manufacturing center, famous for bead-making.</li>
                        <li><strong>Amri:</strong> A key site that showed an earlier, distinct cultural phase *before* the mature Harappan period. This helped establish the chronology of the IVC.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Tragic Death:</strong> Majumdar's dedication to fieldwork was legendary. In 1938, he was tragically shot and killed by dacoits (bandits) while exploring in the Dadu district of Sindh.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Contributions of Braj Basi Lal (B.B. Lal)</h2>
            <p>Professor B.B. Lal represents the post-independence generation of Indian archaeologists. He was one of the first Indians to be trained in scientific excavation by <strong>Sir Mortimer Wheeler</strong> in 1944.</p>
            <p>He later became the <strong>Director-General of the ASI</strong> (1968-1972) and led some of the most important excavations in post-colonial India.</p>

            <h3>Major Contributions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Bridging Epics and Archaeology:</strong> Lal's most famous work tried to find archaeological correlations for the great Indian epics.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>"Archaeology of the Ramayana Sites":</strong> He led excavations at sites mentioned in the Ramayana, including Ayodhya, Bharadwaj Ashram, and Shringaverapura.</li>
                        <li><strong>"Archaeology of the Mahabharata Sites":</strong> He excavated <strong>Hastinapura</strong>, the epic's capital. Here, he famously associated the <strong>Painted Grey Ware (PGW)</strong> culture (an Iron Age culture) with the period of the Mahabharata story.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Harappan Excavations:</strong> He led the major excavation at <strong>Kalibangan</strong> in Rajasthan, a very important IVC site. Discoveries here included a "ploughed field" (the earliest known), fire altars, and a "Lower Town" and "Citadel" complex.</li>
                <li><strong>Training:Readership:</strong> As a professor and DG, he trained and influenced almost every major Indian archaeologist of the next generation.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> B.B. Lal is the key figure connecting Wheeler's scientific methods to a new, indigenous Indian archaeological focus. He is famous for his work on the <strong>"Epic Sites"</strong> (Mahabharata/Ramayana) and his excavation at <strong>Kalibangan</strong>.
