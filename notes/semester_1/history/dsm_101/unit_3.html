        <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction to Vedic Civilisation</h2>
        <p>This period (c. 1500 BCE – 600 BCE) is named after the <strong>Vedas</strong>, the sacred texts of the Indo-Aryans. It marks a shift from the urban IVC to a rural, pastoralist society that gradually becomes an agricultural, territorial kingdom. It is divided into two distinct phases.</p>

        <h2 id="rig-vedic">2. Rig Vedic Period (Early Vedic Period)</h2>
        <p><em>(Approx. 1500 BCE – 1000 BCE)</em></p>
        <p>Our knowledge of this era comes from the <strong>Rig Veda</strong>, the oldest of the Vedas. The society was centered in the <em>Sapta-Sindhu</em> (Punjab) region.</p>

        <h3>i) Rig Vedic Polity</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tribal System:</strong> The main political unit was the tribe, or <strong>Jana</strong>. The king (*Rajan*) was a tribal chieftain, not an absolute ruler.</li>
            <li><strong>King's Role:</strong> His main duty was to protect the tribe and its cattle (*Gopati* - Lord of Cattle). His position was often not hereditary.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemblies:</strong> The king's power was checked by two important tribal assemblies:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sabha:</strong> A council of elders.</li>
                    <li><strong>Samiti:</strong> A general assembly of the entire tribe. <strong>Women were allowed to attend</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>ii) Rig Vedic Economy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pastoralist:</strong> The economy was <strong>primarily pastoral (herding)</strong> and semi-nomadic. <strong>Cattle were the main source of wealth</strong>. Wars (*Gavishti*) were fought for cattle.</li>
            <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> It was a secondary occupation. They grew barley (<em>Yava</em>).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>iii) Rig Vedic Society</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Kinship-Based:</strong> The family (*Kula*) was the basic unit.</li>
            <li><strong>Status of Women:</strong> Women were highly respected. They could attend assemblies, participate in rituals, and even compose hymns (e.g., Lopamudra, Ghosha). Child marriage was not practiced.</li>
            <li><strong>Varna System:</strong> The Varna (class) system was <strong>flexible and based on occupation (Karma), not birth</strong>. The Rig Veda (in a late hymn) mentions the four Varnas, but the hierarchy was not rigid.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>iv) Rig Vedic Religion</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nature Worship:</strong> They worshipped natural forces, personifying them as gods.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Gods:</strong> <strong>Indra</strong> (war/storm), <strong>Agni</strong> (fire, the intermediary), and <strong>Varuna</strong> (cosmic order).</li>
            <li><strong>Rituals:</strong> Worship was simple, involving sacrifices (<strong>Yajnas</strong>) to gain <em>Praja</em> (children) and <em>Pashu</em> (cattle). There were <strong>no temples and no idol worship</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="later-vedic">3. Later Vedic Period</h2>
        <p><em>(Approx. 1000 BCE – 600 BCE)</em></p>
        <p>This period saw profound changes as the Aryans moved eastward into the <strong>Ganga-Yamuna doab</strong> and began using <strong>iron</strong>, which led to an agricultural surplus.</p>

        <h3>i) Later Vedic Polity</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rise of Kingdoms:</strong> The tribal *Janas* consolidated into territorial kingdoms called <strong>Janapadas</strong> (e.g., Kuru, Panchala).</li>
            <li><strong>King's Power Increases:</strong> The king's position became <strong>hereditary</strong> and much more powerful. He performed complex sacrifices (<strong>Rajasuya, Ashvamedha</strong>) to prove his authority.</li>
            <li><strong>Decline of Assemblies:</strong> The Sabha and Samiti lost their importance, and women were no longer allowed to attend.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>ii) Later Vedic Economy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Agricultural:</strong> With the use of <strong>iron ploughs</strong>, agriculture became the main occupation. Rice (<em>Vrihi</em>) and wheat became major crops.</li>
            <li><strong>Crafts:</strong> New crafts like iron-smithing and pottery (Painted Grey Ware - PGW) emerged.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>iii) Later Vedic Society</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rigid Varna System:</strong> The Varna system became <strong>rigid, hierarchical, and based on birth (Janma)</strong>. The Brahmins (priests) and Kshatriyas (warriors) dominated.</li>
            <li><strong>Decline in Status of Women:</strong> The status of women declined significantly. They were barred from assemblies and lost their educational and property rights.</li>
            <li><strong>Concept of Gotra:</strong> The system of *Gotra* (lineage) emerged.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>iv) Later Vedic Religion</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Complex Rituals:</strong> Religion became dominated by complex, expensive, and lengthy <strong>rituals and sacrifices</strong>, which could only be performed by the Brahmin priests.</li>
            <li><strong>New Gods:</strong> The old gods (Indra, Agni) lost their importance. <strong>Prajapati</strong> (The Creator), <strong>Vishnu</strong> (The Preserver), and <strong>Rudra</strong> (an early form of Shiva) became the supreme gods.</li>
            <li><strong>Reaction (Upanishads):</strong> Towards the end of this period, a philosophical reaction against these empty rituals began. This is seen in the <strong>Upanishads</strong>, which emphasized knowledge (<em>Jnana</em>) and the self (<em>Atman</em>), not sacrifice.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="new-religions">5. Religious Systems in the 6th Century BCE</h2>
        <p>The 6th Century BCE was a time of great intellectual and religious ferment, largely as a <strong>reaction against the problems of the Later Vedic period</strong> (ritualism, caste system, Brahmin dominance).</p>

        <h3 id="jainism">i) Jainism: Life & Teachings of Mahavira</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Life:</strong> Vardhamana Mahavira was the 24th and last <strong>Tirthankara</strong> (ford-maker). He was a Kshatriya prince who renounced the world at age 30.</li>
            <li><strong>Core Teachings:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ahimsa (Non-Violence):</strong> This is the central, most extreme principle. Jains believe everything, including rocks and water, has a soul (<em>Jiva</em>) and must not be harmed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rejection of Vedas & Rituals:</strong> Rejected the authority of the Vedas and the dominance of Brahmins.</li>
                    <li><strong>Karma and Rebirth:</strong> Believed in Karma, but the goal is to *completely* shed all Karma to achieve <strong>Kaivalya</strong> (liberation).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Five Vows:</strong> 1. <strong>Ahimsa</strong> (Non-violence), 2. <strong>Satya</strong> (Truth), 3. <strong>Asteya</strong> (Non-stealing), 4. <strong>Aparigraha</strong> (Non-possession), and 5. <strong>Brahmacharya</strong> (Celibacy) (this was the vow added by Mahavira).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="buddhism">ii) Buddhism: Life & Teachings of Gautama Buddha</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Life:</strong> Siddhartha Gautama, a Kshatriya prince. Key events: Birth (Lumbini), Great Renunciation, Enlightenment (Bodh Gaya), First Sermon (Sarnath), Death (Kushinagar).</li>
            <li><strong>Core Teachings:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Four Noble Truths:</strong>
                        1. The world is full of suffering (<em>Dukkha</em>).
                        2. The cause of suffering is desire (<em>Tanha</em>).
                        3. Suffering can be ended.
                        4. The way to end suffering is the <strong>Eightfold Path</strong> (<em>Ashtangika Marga</em>).</li>
                    <li><strong>The Middle Path (Madhyama Marga):</strong> The Buddha's core philosophy. It rejects both extremes: a life of luxury and a life of extreme self-torture. This moderation made it very popular.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rejection of Vedas & Caste:</strong> He rejected the authority of the Vedas and the caste system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Language:</strong> Taught in <strong>Pali</strong>, the language of the common people, not Sanskrit.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
