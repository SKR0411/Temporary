        <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Maurya Empire (c. 322 BCE – 185 BCE) was the first and largest <strong>pan-Indian empire</strong>, a vast centralized state that controlled almost the entire subcontinent. Its foundation by Chandragupta Maurya and the reign of Ashoka represent a pivotal moment in Indian history.</p>

        <h2 id="expansion">2. Mauryan Expansion</h2>

        <h3 id="cgm">i) Chandragupta Maurya (c. 322–298 BCE)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Founder:</strong> He founded the empire by overthrowing the last Nanda ruler, <strong>Dhana Nanda</strong>, with the help of his advisor, <strong>Kautilya (Chanakya)</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Conquests:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Northwest:</strong> He took advantage of the power vacuum left by Alexander's departure and conquered the entire Indus valley region.</li>
                    <li><strong>War with Seleucus Nicator (c. 305 BCE):</strong> He fought a successful war against Seleucus, Alexander's general. In the treaty, Chandragupta gained a vast territory (modern-day Afghanistan and Balochistan) and married Seleucus's daughter.</li>
                    <li><strong>South:</strong> He expanded his empire into the Deccan, creating a massive, unified state.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="ashoka">ii) Ashoka (c. 268–232 BCE)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Kalinga War (c. 261 BCE):</strong> Ashoka's only major war, which he won. The massive bloodshed (described in his <strong>Rock Edict XIII</strong>) horrified him.</li>
            <li><strong>Change of Heart:</strong> After the war, he had a profound change of heart. He abandoned the policy of physical conquest (<em>Bherighosha</em>) and adopted a policy of cultural conquest (<strong><em>Dhammaghosha</em></strong>).</li>
            <li><strong>Conversion:</strong> He became a devout Buddhist and dedicated the rest of his reign and the state's resources to spreading his policy of Dhamma.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="dhamma">3. Ashoka's Dhamma</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>What is Dhamma?</strong> It is <strong>not a religion</strong>. It is a <strong>moral and ethical code of conduct</strong> based on social responsibility, aimed at creating a harmonious and peaceful society in his vast, diverse empire.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Key Principles of Dhamma (from his Edicts):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ahimsa:</strong> Non-violence to all living beings (including a ban on animal sacrifice).</li>
            <li><strong>Respect (Seva):</strong> Respect for elders, teachers, parents, and ascetics (Brahmins and Sramanas).</li>
            <li><strong>Religious Tolerance:</strong> He actively preached respect for all religious sects.</li>
            <li><strong>Proper Conduct:</strong> Humane treatment of servants and slaves (*Dasas*).</li>
            <li><strong>Rejection of Rituals:</strong> He dismissed many common ceremonies as "petty and worthless."</li>
            <li><strong>New Officials:</strong> He created a new class of officials called the <strong>Dhamma Mahamattas</strong> to spread and enforce this moral code.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="admin">4. Maurya Administration</h2>
        <p>The Mauryan state was a <strong>highly centralized bureaucratic monarchy</strong>, as described in the Arthashastra.</p>

        <h2 id="art">5. Mauryan Art and Architecture</h2>
        <p>Mauryan art is the first great imperial art of India. It was commissioned by the state and is known for its impressive scale and polish.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pillars:</strong> This is the most famous feature.
                <ul>
                    <li>They were <strong>monolithic</strong> (carved from a single piece of stone).</li>
                    <li>They had a characteristic <strong>lustrous polish</strong> that still shines today.</li>
                    <li>They were topped with magnificent animal capitals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> The <strong>Lion Capital at Sarnath</strong>, which has been adopted as the National Emblem of India.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Stupas:</strong> Ashoka is said to have built 84,000 stupas (large hemispherical mounds) to enshrine the relics of the Buddha. The original brick core of the <strong>Sanchi Stupa</strong> dates from this period.</li>
            <li><strong>Caves:</strong> Ashoka and his grandson Dasharatha sponsored the carving of rock-cut caves, such as the <strong>Barabar Caves</strong> near Gaya, which were donated to the Ajivika monks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="decline">6. The Decline of the Mauryan Empire</h2>
        <p>The mighty empire collapsed within 50 years of Ashoka's death (c. 185 BCE). There was no single cause, but a combination of factors.</p>

        <h3>Key Theories for Decline:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Weak Successors:</strong> Ashoka's sons and grandsons were weak and unable to control the vast, complex empire.</li>
            <li><strong>Brahminical Reaction (H.P. Shastri's Theory):</strong> Ashoka's policies (banning sacrifice, promoting Ahimsa) and his perceived favoritism towards Buddhism angered the Brahmins. This is supported by the fact that the last Mauryan king, <strong>Brihadratha</strong>, was assassinated by his Brahmin general, <strong>Pushyamitra Shunga</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Strain:</strong> The massive cost of maintaining a standing army and a huge bureaucracy, plus Ashoka's grants to monasteries, may have bankrupted the treasury.</li>
            <li><strong>Oppressive Provincial Rule:</strong> Ashoka's own edicts mention that he worried about the misrule of "wicked" officials in provinces like Taxila, leading to popular revolts.</li>
            <li><strong>Vastness and Communication:</strong> The sheer size of the empire made it difficult to control from the center in an age of slow communication.</li>
        </ul>
