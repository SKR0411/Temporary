        <h2 id="condition-6th-bce">1. Political Condition in the 6th Century BCE</h2>
        <p>The 6th Century BCE was a major turning point, marking the beginning of India's historical period. It is often called the era of <strong>"Second Urbanisation"</strong> (the first being the IVC), as the agricultural surplus from the Ganga valley led to the re-emergence of cities and trade.</p>
        
        <h3>The 16 Mahajanapadas</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This period saw the end of the old *Janapadas* (tribal kingdoms) and the rise of <strong>16 large territorial states</strong>, or <strong>Mahajanapadas</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Source:</strong> This famous list of 16 kingdoms is provided in the Buddhist text <strong>Anguttara Nikaya</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Two Types of States:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Monarchies:</strong> Ruled by powerful kings. The most important were <strong>Magadha, Kosala, Vatsa, and Avanti</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Republics (Ganas/Sanghas):</strong> Ruled not by a single king but by an assembly of nobles or clan chiefs. The most famous were the <strong>Vajji</strong> (of the Licchavis, with their capital at Vaishali) and the <strong>Mallas</strong>.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>This period was characterized by intense political struggle as these 16 states fought each other for supremacy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="rise-of-magadha">2. Rise of Magadha</h2>
        <p>Out of the 16 Mahajanapadas, the kingdom of <strong>Magadha</strong> (in modern-day Bihar) eventually emerged as the most powerful, absorbing all its rivals and laying the foundation for India's first great empire.</p>

        <div class="important-note">
            <strong>Exam Question: "Why did Magadha rise to supremacy?"</strong>
            <p>This was due to a unique combination of geographic, economic, political, and military factors.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1. Economic Strength:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Rich Iron Deposits:</strong> Magadha had easy access to the rich iron ore deposits of Chota Nagpur. This allowed them to make <strong>stronger weapons and better agricultural tools</strong> (like iron ploughs).</li>
                        <li><strong>Fertile Soil:</strong> Located in the heart of the fertile Ganga valley, it produced a massive agricultural surplus, which fed the army and filled the treasury.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>2. Geographic Advantage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Strategic Capitals:</strong> Its first capital, <strong>Rajgir</strong> (or Girivraja), was surrounded by five hills, making it a natural, impregnable fort. Its second capital, <strong>Pataliputra</strong> (modern Patna), was a "water fort" (<em>Jaladurga</em>) located at the confluence of four rivers (Ganga, Son, Gandak, Ghaghra), allowing it to control all river-based trade and communication.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>3. Military Power:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>First Use of Elephants:</strong> Magadha was the first kingdom to use <strong>war elephants</strong> on a large scale, which gave it a terrifying advantage against armies that relied only on horses and chariots.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>4. Ambitious Rulers (Political Factor):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Haryanka Dynasty:</strong> <strong>Bimbisara</strong> (used matrimonial alliances) and his son <strong>Ajatashatru</strong> (waged aggressive wars to conquer Kosala and the Vajji republic).</li>
                        <li><strong>Nanda Dynasty:</strong> Founded by <strong>Mahapadma Nanda</strong>, often called the "first empire builder of India." He defeated all remaining Kshatriya kingdoms. The last Nanda ruler, <strong>Dhana Nanda</strong>, was overthrown by Chandragupta Maurya.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 id="foreign-invasions">3. Foreign Invasions</h2>
        <p>While Magadha was rising in the east, the northwest of India (Punjab region) was politically fragmented and wealthy, making it an easy target for invasion.</p>

        <h3 id="persian-invasion">i) Persian Invasion and Darius I</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Invasion:</strong> Around 518 BCE, the Persian Achaemenid Emperor, <strong>Darius I</strong>, conquered parts of the northwest, including Sindh and western Punjab.</li>
            <li><strong>Effects of Persian Contact:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>It became the <strong>20th Satrapy (province)</strong> of the Persian Empire and paid a huge annual tribute in gold.</li>
                    <li>It opened up trade and cultural contact between India and Persia.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>Kharoshthi script</strong>, an Aramaic-derived script used in northwest India for centuries (and in Ashokan edicts), was introduced by the Persians.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="greek-invasion">ii) Greek Invasion: Alexander's Invasion and its effects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Invasion (327-325 BCE):</strong> After conquering the Persian Empire, <strong>Alexander the Great</strong> of Macedon (Greece) marched into India.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Events:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The ruler of Taxila, <strong>Ambhi (Omphis)</strong>, surrendered without a fight.</li>
                    <li><strong>Battle of Hydaspes (326 BCE):</strong> Alexander fought his most famous battle against <strong>King Porus (Paurava)</strong> on the banks of the river Jhelum (Greek: *Hydaspes*). Porus fought bravely but was defeated. Alexander, impressed by his courage, restored his kingdom.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mutiny on the Beas:</strong> Alexander's army, exhausted and intimidated by reports of the massive Nanda army further east, mutinied at the river Beas (Greek: *Hyphasis*). This forced Alexander to turn back.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="effects-alexander">Effects of Alexander's Invasion:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Political Unification:</strong> By destroying the small, warring tribal states in the northwest, Alexander's invasion <strong>paved the way for Chandragupta Maurya</strong> to easily conquer the region and build his empire.</li>
            <li><strong>Direct Indo-Greek Contact:</strong> It opened the first direct land and sea routes between India and Europe, leading to increased trade and cultural exchange.</li>
            <li><strong>Historical Dating:</strong> It gave Indian history its <strong>first firm "anchor date"</strong>. The date of the invasion (326 BCE) is confirmed in Greek records, allowing historians to date other events (like the accession of Chandragupta) relative to it.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural Influence:</strong> It led to the later development of the <strong>Gandhara School of Art</strong>, a unique blend of Greek realism and Indian Buddhist themes.</li>
        </ol>
