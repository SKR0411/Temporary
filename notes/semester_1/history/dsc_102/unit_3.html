        <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Gupta Empire (c. 320 CE – 550 CE) ushered in an era of political stability and cultural efflorescence often termed the <strong>"Classical Age"</strong> or <strong>"Golden Age"</strong> of Ancient India. They reunited North India after centuries of fragmentation.</p>

        <h2 id="great-rulers">2. Samudragupta & Chandragupta II: Conquests and Achievements</h2>

        <h3>i) Samudragupta (c. 335–375 CE)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Source:</strong> Our main source is the <strong>Allahabad Pillar Inscription (Prayaga Prasasti)</strong>, composed by his court poet, <strong>Harishena</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>"Napoleon of India":</strong> He was a military genius who embarked on a vast campaign of conquest. The Prasasti details his complex military policies:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Aryavarta (North India):</strong> A policy of <em>Prasaboddharana</em> (violent uprooting). He defeated 9 kings and directly annexed their territories.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dakshinapatha (South India):</strong> A policy of <em>Grahana-Moksha-Anugraha</em> (capturing, liberating, and favoring). He defeated 12 kings but returned their kingdoms, making them his vassals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Frontier & Tribal States:</strong> They paid tribute and obeyed his orders.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cultural Achievements:</strong> He was not just a warrior. He was a poet and musician (titled *Kaviraja*). His coins show him <strong>playing the Veena</strong>. He also performed the <strong>Ashvamedha</strong> sacrifice.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>ii) Chandragupta II "Vikramaditya" (c. 375–415 CE)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Greatest Military Achievement:</strong> His definitive victory over the <strong>Western Kshatrapas (Shakas)</strong> in Gujarat.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> This gave the Guptas control over the crucial western seaports (like Bharuch/Broach), leading to a massive boom in trade with the Roman world.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Title:</strong> He adopted the title <strong>Vikramaditya</strong> (Sun of Valour), which became a legendary name.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural Peak:</strong> His reign is considered the peak of Gupta culture. His court at Ujjain was supposedly adorned by the <strong>Navaratnas (Nine Gems)</strong>, including the great poet <strong>Kalidasa</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Visitor:</strong> The Chinese Buddhist pilgrim <strong>Fa-Hien (Faxian)</strong> visited India during his reign, providing a valuable account of the society.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="admin">3. Gupta Administration</h2>
        <p>The Gupta administration was a significant departure from the Mauryan system. It was <strong>much more decentralized</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>King:</strong> Adopted grand titles like *Maharajadhiraja* (King of great kings) and *Parameshwara* (Supreme lord).</li>
            <li><strong>Central:</strong> The king was assisted by a council of ministers (*Mantrins*) and high officials like the *Sandhivigrahika* (Minister of War and Peace) and *Kumaramatyas*.</li>
            <li><strong>Provincial (Bhukti):</strong> Provinces were governed by *Uparikas* (Governors).</li>
            <li><strong>District (Vishaya):</strong> Districts were governed by a *Vishayapati*.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key Feature:</strong> The Vishayapati was assisted by a <strong>district council</strong>, which included local representatives:
                        <li><em>Nagara-Sreshthin</em> (Chief Merchant)</li>
                        <li><em>Sarthavaha</em> (Caravan/Trade Guild Leader)</li>
                        <li><em>Prathama-Kulika</em> (Chief Artisan)</li>
                        <li><em>Prathama-Kayastha</em> (Chief Scribe)</li>
                    This shows a degree of local participation not seen under the Mauryas.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Village (Grama):</strong> Headed by a *Gramika* or *Gramadhyaksha*.</li>
            <li><strong>Rise of Feudalism:</strong> The most important feature was the large-scale issuance of <strong>land grants</strong> (*Brahmadeya*, *Agrahara*) to Brahmins and temples, often with tax exemptions and administrative rights. Officials were also increasingly paid in land grants instead of cash. This weakened central control and laid the groundwork for a feudal structure.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="golden-age">4. Gupta Age - Golden Age (A Debate)</h2>
        <p>This period is called a "Golden Age" due to its extraordinary achievements in culture, art, and science. However, this label is also debated by historians.</p>

            <strong>Exam Question: "Was the Gupta period truly a 'Golden Age'?"</strong>
            <br>
            <strong>How to Answer:</strong> This is a "critically analyze" question. Do not just say "yes."
            <br>1. Start by explaining *why* it is called a Golden Age (list the achievements in literature, science, art).
            <br>2. Then, provide the *critique* (social rigidity, status of women, feudalism).
            <br>3. Conclude that while it was a "Classical Age" or a "peak" for elite culture and science, the term "Golden Age" is an overstatement as it ignores the harsh realities for most of the population.

        <h2 id="decline">5. The Decline of the Gupta Power</h2>
        <p>The Gupta empire declined in the 6th Century CE due to a combination of factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Huna Invasions:</strong> This was the <strong>primary cause</strong>. The Hunas (a branch of White Huns from Central Asia) launched repeated, devastating invasions from the northwest.
                <ul>
                    <li>The Gupta king <strong>Skandagupta</strong> initially fought them off successfully, but the wars were a massive drain on the treasury.</li>
                    <li>Later invasions by Huna chiefs like <strong>Toramana</strong> and <strong>Mihirakula</strong> broke the empire's power.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Rise of Feudatories:</strong> The decentralized, feudal administrative structure was a "fair-weather" system. As soon as the central power (the king) weakened, the powerful feudatories and governors (like the Maukharis, Maitrakas) declared their independence, fragmenting the empire.</li>
            <li><strong>Weak Successors:</strong> The later Gupta rulers (after Skandagupta) were weak, incompetent, and unable to manage the internal and external crises.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Decline:</strong> The Huna invasions disrupted the lucrative trade routes to the west. A decline in the purity of Gupta gold coins from this period suggests a severe financial crisis.</li>
        </ul>
